This is Soul of reason a program that will examine the roots of the black box Soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University

Speaker 2 00:00:48.980
The black presence in classical music has been largely ignored in the music world until now The New York Philharmonic will help to remedy this with a celebration of music by black composers from August twenty ninth to September 2nd at Lincoln Center and with us this evening on sole reason to discuss the celebration as Dr. Leon Thompson who is director of education activities for the New York Philharmonic

Speaker 3 00:01:14.300
And we're glad to have you with us this evening Leon Thank you It's a pleasure to be here Well what about the tradition of blacks in classical music I understand it goes back a long way Yes So as we were talking before the show someone said that maybe even Beethoven was black If we use the contemporary criterion for what constitutes a black person why do you know it goes back even beyond Beethoven

Speaker 4 00:01:38.480
We have music and scores from composers who were black who wrote at the time that Mozart lived And as a matter of fact one of those works is going to be performed during the celebration by music whose music is that experience newness Garcia He's a black composer from Brazil and he was the court composer during the time that he was alive quite a prolific composer As a matter of fact most of his music was vocal He did write some extraordinary music but we have because of the recent research quite a bit of music there have been there has been written by black composers not only the seventeen hundred eighteen hundred nineteen hundred right up until the present day and the celebration that we are planning incidentally covers a span of 200 years of music tied in with the bicentennial and you know just recently we had on the program two centuries of black American art Yes celebrating the exhibit over at the Brooklyn Museum I conducted some concerts during the bicentennial of 200 years of music by black composers But this is a different motivation this time Well what is the motivation Well we have been trying to highlight the musical black composers for many years When I say we have I'm thinking about many of the black composers Of course I am connected with the New York Philharmonic and it is logical I think that they which is the finest orchestra in this country and the oldest orchestras should suddenly celebrate and highlight the contributions of these people who has who have been neglected over the years by the way

Speaker 3 00:03:16.300
How old is the New York Philharmonic

Speaker 5 00:03:18.890
I think we are starting out one hundred and thirty seventh very eighth season

Speaker 6 00:03:23.910
I see and that is the oldest is the oldest in this country and second only to the Vienna Philharmonic is the second oldest orchestra in the world

Speaker 3 00:03:32.640
It really is interesting given the long tradition of classical music Why is it that philharmonic orchestras have more recently come on the scene If you call a hundred and thirty nine years more recently given the tradition of the long tradition of classical music Why is it that organizations like the Vienna Symphony or the New York Philharmonic really only came on the scene This would be back in the 18th 40s I guess

Speaker 5 00:03:57.770
Yes well these orchestras have been they have been continuous in the operations they have been made many orchestras have started stopping and during the course of this time but these orchestras have been continuous in the operation and of course their contributions have been fantastic over the period of years

Speaker 7 00:04:14.150
Why is it that the classical world is sort of largely ignored black composers and certainly black performers it's only recently that people like Leontyne Price and purely by debt and several others became well known in the field of opera A long period of time we've had people like William Grant Still Ann Coulter's Taylor and Roland Hayes and people of that type who are black and we're in the classical music field is it the traditional racial prejudice that is kept then ignored or is it the fact that they just haven't been identified or they've been identified

Speaker 4 00:04:52.280
But here again the music world simply reflected the social thinking of the time and we can go back as far as or their early nineteen hundreds when one of the first black performers with the New York Philharmonic incident was also a white a black violinist and he has a piece instantly on this festival that we are going to be playing It has been very difficult

Speaker 5 00:05:19.220
It has been a struggle for a long time for Black not only in terms of voice but pianist and violinists and conductors to find their place in the classical world And there were singers long before then team price and Shirley Virat and Roland Hayes and so forth but they had to sing in their own companies and they either had to go to Europe and sometimes when they went there they just did not come back They lived over there and remained there

Speaker 3 00:05:46.110
Why did Europe accept them better than

Speaker 4 00:05:49.500
Because because of the same social climate it's a matter of the climate in which we lived at that time And I'm sure that the reason why I sing is gold to America today The reason why I go to Europe today is because are more opera houses there And the people love to hear their voices and they look at that color last you know the idea of the black composer is a little unusual We think about Pushkin as a Russian but we don't We don't call him a black Russian even though his his mother was black Beethoven tell us about it Well I couldn't simply tell you that Thayer who is Beethoven's biographer mentioned that he was dark and that he had a dark color and that kind of thing I think under the standards that we would consider black today if both of them were alive he would be considered black

Speaker 8 00:06:46.410
That's that's quite an argued point Some people say he is and some people say he isn't I'm just a German composer you see and the same way with Pushkin they say he's just a Russian writer

Speaker 3 00:06:57.480
But the key point in terms of the tradition of Afro Americans and culture and history and the like is that unlike the stereotype that blacks have no culture we're not involved in the cultural mainstream Both Pushkin and the works of steel and others shows that blacks have always been involved in whatever mainstream exist in whatever society they are

Speaker 5 00:07:20.460
That's true That is very true I mentioned wholesale White for instance as a violinist who performed with the New York Philharmonic at the time he lived in Paris

Speaker 8 00:07:28.980
He was the darling of the Paris society and all of this is indicated in terms of the newspaper clippings and the basic research that one has to go to when when when one tries to find this information And it's amazing how they simply refer to those and so who's who was in Africa or who was black in passing but keep saying how wonderful he was as a violinist or how wonderful he was as a composer They don't suggest that they don't stress his blackness

Speaker 2 00:07:55.050
What about the celebration of music by black composers Is this your idea is it someone else's idea How is it going to take place I know that well in the August 20 9th September second at Avery Fisher Hall and the library Lincoln Center and outside possibly in the mall But how did this get put together What's the purpose of it What's your role etc.

Speaker 9 00:08:16.590
Well you know in past years there have been as I should say the past four or five years several symposia of music by black composers have been held throughout the country One in Houston with the Houston Symphony one in Minnesota with the Minnesota Orchestra I wanted to chart with the Detroit Symphony And Paul Freeman was the conductor and director of those symposia What happened was the various composers would submit works to a committee and several works would be selected They would read through the works and of course of the week and then at the end of the week they would give a concert of the best works of course the New York Philharmonic is not doing a symposium we are doing a complete festival a week of programs five concerts one each night beginning on Monday August twenty ninth of music by black composers and we are highlighting some of the works that we've discovered in the earlier symposia as well as presenting what has not been done a complete recital of art songs by black composers as well as a piano recital by music of music by black composers

Speaker 3 00:09:29.180
Now is this an attempt by the Philip monarch to get a broader outreach to the black community or is an attempt to educate the entire cultural community about black classical music

Speaker 9 00:09:40.530
I think it would encompass both I think you know last year the New York Philharmonic participated in what we called a festival of contemporary music and that was one I think black composer listed in that group of composers who were performed during that time This year we are doing a complete festival of music by black composers and I'm sure that one of their reasons is that they want the public to know that there is some very fine music written by black composers

Speaker 3 00:10:10.980
And then of course you may not want to comment on this but the Philharmonic as an institution has been frequently as in many of our cultural institutions been accused of ignoring blacks or yeah in terms of playing in the Philharmonic and administrative positions and I think it's quite a credit to you that you are able to function within an organization as prestigious as the Philharmonic And I just wonder if this isn't an attempt in part on the part of the Philharmonic to gain some credibility in the larger black community

Speaker 10 00:10:40.240
Well I certainly hope that it does

Speaker 4 00:10:43.460
Most is surely the New York Philharmonic is interested in certainly highlighting the very good work of all American composers and they certainly do not want to overlook the black composers and I can say that because I am partly responsible for the programming of the music that they play in Leon Thompson in particular has studied William Grant Still whose Afro American symphony We're going to hear some excerpts from yes

Speaker 3 00:12:50.700
That is really beautiful music and you can almost feel the pulse of blacks as they arrived here and work on a plantation and lived in New Orleans Yes and so on and I guess that's what still was trying to tell us in

Speaker 9 00:13:04.920
Oh I think so that is definitely what I would consider indigenous music It comes from the soil and we will have some music like that at the festival and there would be some music built around the element of jazz on the festival and there would be some music that's built around the 20th century compositional techniques like twelve tone music or avant garde Cecil Taylor's work there won't be any music by Cecil Taylor

Speaker 4 00:13:37.350
There will be some music by coders Taylor Perkins Claude was still a person There would be some music by your listeners There will be some music by George Walker a wonderful piano concerto he's written by a Panamanian composer Roque Cordero will have a violin concerto performed

Speaker 9 00:13:57.090
We have really covered this band of using both women composers and young composers and established composers a complete spectrum of music covering really a span of 200 years covering the entire black experience

Speaker 3 00:14:13.170
How are you going to integrate the jazz because jazz is so much a part of the black variant

Speaker 4 00:14:18.400
Yes I'm going to one of the concerts that I'm conducting a young cellist Eugene Meyer will be playing David Baker's cello concerto and David Baker was a jazz musician before he became became Professor of Composition at Indiana University He has written a very fine composition and this young cellist is going to play it for us at the final concert

Speaker 2 00:14:46.620
This composition is built around the element of jazz now for people in the audience who want to learn more about this concert is there a phone number they could call or is there a ticket office they can contact

Speaker 4 00:15:00.270
Yes indeed We have a very wonderful ticket situation I think involving the festival they should call 5 8 0 8 700 which is the New York Philharmonic number 5 8 or 8 700 The tickets are popular prices 3 4 and 5 dollars an issue by the entire series You can get three concerts for the price of two and basically this puts it within the range of the average set

Speaker 11 00:15:30.210
That's right So you want to deal with very much so

Speaker 4 00:15:33.350
And we also have two free concerts that will take place at the Lincoln Center Library The first when the opening concert is that on Monday evening on Tuesday evening the core concert using the Morgan State University course during the mass by Nicholas Garcia from Brazil is on Tuesday in a official hall Wednesday evening The piano recital is free at the library and the other two concerts on Thursday and Friday I in Fisher

Speaker 11 00:16:00.930
What time will the evening concerts be Each of the concert starts at eight thirty eight thirty eight at the Library at Lincoln Center Library and at the ave official Hall I see

Speaker 2 00:16:11.250
So I think it's important for those in the audience who are interested to call the Philharmonic area code 2 1 2 5 8 0 8 700 for information about the celebration of music by black composers another black composer who's done some very interesting work is you list them Who in celebration of dog how Michele's Memorial composed a piece marking markings Yeah which relates to dog commercials All right writings So we will now hear some of Ulysses KS markings

Speaker 12 00:19:06.830
That was Ulysses KS markings which I understand it was written as a tribute today How Michelle and really takes its name from how Michelle's writing

Speaker 8 00:19:18.050
Yes He called markings You know Mr. K is distinguished professor of music at Lehman College here in New York City And it's interesting to note the wide difference in the music that Mr. K is writing and the news that William Grant Still wrote Why is that Well they live at different times I think they were they are reacting to the the motivation of their time and that is what is their own interest You know William Grant Still started out experimenting with new sounds and finally decided that he wanted to concentrate his writings on the ethnic aspect of his race Another composer Francis Mr. K has not made the decision to to simply concentrate his writing on the ethnic aspect of his of his race

Speaker 2 00:20:05.290
He is interested in writing good music and in the final analysis this is what's counts but say this raises the question that was almost always raised when you pick out black literature black art black dance black classical music everything possible with the exception of jazz As to why you choose to pull together a program or a book or an exhibit or a concert that focuses just on black composers in this one why do you do that

Speaker 8 00:20:37.520
In this case the black composers show such a wide variety of of of styles that the entire festival is gonna be really quite exciting very very exciting with something in it for everybody But I think our main interest in this case is the fact that black composers have not had this kind of forum you know at the client at the time discussed The celebration is taking place that would be 117 music critics here from all over the United States This has taken place at the same time that the national music critics association is having its annual meeting Black singers black instrumentalists black composers black artists can never get a better forum than to perform for the entire music critics association in this country

Speaker 12 00:21:28.070
Of course you really saying it not only is this an artistic presentation but it's also a political statement It's a statement about a significant significant segment of people in our society who have been excluded from the mainstream and the census is one opportunity to bring them into the mainstream

Speaker 10 00:21:44.060
This is a showcase showing composers and performers of all of the black race and it is showing them at a time when they can be highlighted

Speaker 12 00:21:56.970
Well how do you rate it How do you answer the criticism of some critics mostly mostly white who say why should we look at black order Why should we look at black music We don't look at Jewish music We don't look at music but they do

Speaker 10 00:22:09.500
Of course the big one is that they don't call it that but they do Whenever a conductor from Italy comes to the New York Philharmonic he always brings in Italian composer He just happens to be white But but if if if there's a Polish conductor coming to conduct the New York Philharmonic you can bet your life as a Polish composer on that program And my reaction is I'm a black conductor Why can I conduct the music of black composers

Speaker 6 00:22:33.650
And of course that doesn't exclude you from conducting the music of other But it's you know it's all anybody else should Sure All right

Speaker 12 00:22:40.290
Well what about the general interest of the black community particularly black youth and classical music

Speaker 13 00:22:46.520
I know many years ago going out of schools like the Howard University Conservatory of Music and in Atlanta University and some of the major centers such as Fisk in Tennessee there were blacks being trained and educated in classical music a long tradition in classical music

Speaker 12 00:23:08.870
I remember as a kid sitting through endless number of concerts one of which had both George Walker and Frances Walker

Speaker 6 00:23:15.530
Oh yeah to a high school in Washington D.C. playing and they were geniuses and that George was one of George Walker's pieces is on his program that marvelous composer

Speaker 13 00:23:26.450
And they were geniuses at that time but now with the popularity of jazz and the fact that so many of your creative black musicians people like Herbie Hancock right Stevie Wonder and people of that type have had classical training but then transferred over into the jazz medium they did

Speaker 12 00:23:46.250
Why why is it that there are not many blacks as many in the classical music today and what can we do to get more into it

Speaker 10 00:23:54.200
Well that there isn't any one two three question answer type situation as an answer to that question I wish I had the time to go into detail But I can say no one

Speaker 8 00:24:07.210
Hubert Laws and persons like that who have marvelous classical background and who have a first rate artist sometimes go into the jazz area because it's economically more feasible for them to do so I hasten to add however that if the doors were open for Hubert Laws to get into a symphony orchestra earlier I think he would have taken that regardless of the fact that he might have made more money in jazz music because that puts an exclamation point behind the purpose of the celebrated shows like a black composer to as you said earlier to help to bring them into the mainstream yes

Speaker 14 00:24:42.340
And the other thing is at Howard University and and other schools of that type you know black colleges are still churning out verified black performers Unfortunately the the instrumentalist does not have the same entree as the singers do Black violinist and black cellist black pianists have a little bit more difficult time making it It's not easy for anybody now but any challenge that's right And even in the in terms of blacks the black female singer will get a better chance at performing than the black violinist

Speaker 9 00:25:18.010
That's still the a result of this social structure and the whole political way of thinking about blacks and what they're capable of doing isn't music colorblind

Speaker 12 00:25:28.830
Well one says that but the music itself is those who handle it aren't always colorblind is what we are aware of in all ranges of the arts is that there is a social factor in every aspect So yes is it manages and serves the people who in every aspect of our lives

Speaker 10 00:25:48.100
We must realize this There is no panacea There is no open way an easy way for anybody Americans in general have it more difficult in this country in classical music than than foreigners because of a very very long tradition of everything coming from Europe That was good that teachers were from Europe the languages the German French and Italian and so forth So we'll still battling that one doesn't think that American Composers should be as great as they say let's say a German composer for instance Oh yeah We have to battle at that We have to fight that

Speaker 12 00:26:22.510
We really have the same thing as bad to say even in sports in soccer for example which is a European import rigidly American soccer players have more difficult time and then when you go beyond that black Americans have an even more difficult time with it

Speaker 10 00:26:37.440
There are individuals who stand out you know they're always the one the two or three who are who are stars but for the general person who is very talented who can who can perform very well He may find a little bit more difficult here than if he goes to another country France

Speaker 12 00:26:54.280
What about my black organizations like the symphony the new world How are they doing

Speaker 10 00:26:57.970
It's a marvelous organization and let me take this opportunity to say to all persons listeners that this is an organization that deserves the support of all persons It is the only organization of its kind in the country and it is an absolute first rate professional orchestra We need all the support that we can get and make no doubt about it were not for the symphony never knew well black composers like conductors black performers would not have a forum

Speaker 12 00:27:31.060
I think that's an excellent statement because it does reflect the struggle that blacks have gone through and are still going through to gain entry into this area of classical music This area culture which has largely been excluded because of the racism it permeates the society And one of the things we try to point up on solar reason is that the movement of blacks toward first class citizenship totally involves every particular facet of our society And that's particularly true with classical music and art literature every particular area Again those in the audience who are interested in getting information about the celebration of music by black composers should contact the New York Philharmonic at area code 2 1 2 5 8 0 8 700 Our guest tonight on total reason has been Dr. Leon Thompson who is director of education activities at the New York Philharmonic and we've been talking about this really fantastic celebration of Black Classical music that will be held at the Philharmonic

Speaker 10 00:28:27.880
Thank you It's going to be very exciting you shouldn't really miss it

Speaker 15 00:28:32.170
