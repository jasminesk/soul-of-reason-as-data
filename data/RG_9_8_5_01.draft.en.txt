Speaker 1 00:00:01.540
A few weeks ago 38 black and Hispanic athletes were inducted into the Black Sports Hall of Fame causing considerable comment from the press Allen Baron publisher of Black sports magazine will discuss the Black Sports Hall of Fame on tonight soul of reason This is Soul of reason a program that will examine the roots of the black box

Speaker 2 00:00:46.760
Soul of reason is produced by BW NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University

Speaker 3 00:01:07.540
I witnessed today on soul of reason as Alan Barron of black sports magazine and you've been in the press quite recently and quite often because of the Black Sports Hall of Fame that black sports magazine has started and I was just wondering what is your overall reaction to the comment that says a black sports hall of fame is resegregation

Speaker 4 00:01:31.610
Well of course I am immediately indignant any kind of allegation about reverse segregation and discrimination on our part because anyone with any kind of minimal intellect can understand that the strength of an individual lies in his cognizance or his consciousness of himself And one of the major problems with black America is the fact that it has been reduced to a group of individuals who know basically very little about themselves So as a result our attempt with a black sports hall of fame is to provide not only the black community but the entire American population with a very substantial role that sports has played in the struggle for survival in black America and to build in black America That level of consciousness which is very very sorely needed to make us a better American citizens and be very candid about it

Speaker 5 00:02:23.170
Okay Well that's a excellent explication of why you have developed a black sports hall of fame but how do you deal with a criticism like this They said if somebody saw it at a white sports hall of fame everybody would be crying segregation and blacks in particular would be upset about it

Speaker 4 00:02:39.260
I would like to say and make this declaration to every Hall of Fame in America they are white sports halls of fame Just recently they started inducting brothers into Hall of Fame around this country So I mean it's it's a ridiculous allegation to say that if someone started a hall a White Hall of Fame Cooperstown was white for years Can't know how was white for years in fact These places are ridiculously white because so many of the super super athletes were black athletes If I could I could just talk to you for a few minutes about the Racing Hall of Fame It was so ridiculous What happened there Isaac Murphy he got in because he had to do something that nobody else had ever done he won the Kentucky Derby three times But in addition to that they used to rate the horses over the over the jockeys to the extent that there are horses names in racing's hall of fame But the jockeys were all black at that time so they didn't even list them at all

Speaker 5 00:03:35.680
Yeah Cause that may not necessarily have been because they were black it might have just been because of the way in which they didn't think the jockeys were important I think everybody now knows the jockeys are probably at least as important maybe more important in the horse

Speaker 4 00:03:47.870
I would refute that with you because it was particularly because the jockeys were black You see the institution of horse racing was an English sport that the English gentleman never would sit the back of a horse What they did is they use their indentured servants or their slaves to be the horsemen for them and eight sit around outside with their ladies in their meal baskets their picnic baskets and watch these jockeys race these animals these beast of burden up and down they wouldn't touch these things It was only when horse racing became a very profitable venture Did white jockeys become prevalent in the United States

Speaker 6 00:04:20.329.9999999999709
Although it's very interesting now speaking of jockeys so many of the top jockeys are Spanish Hispanic backgrounds

Speaker 4 00:04:27.020
That's that's true and because of their slight build is probably a function of Bill

Speaker 5 00:04:32.270
But let's get back to this whole idea of the Black Sports Hall of Fame You made a very good point when you say that basically most sports hall of fame white and that's probably because other than just the prejudice 90 percent of the population in America 89 percent of it is white So that by definition most sports hall of fame generally would have a large number of whites in it On the other hand there have been a number of blacks who have been very proficient in a variety of sports particularly some of the older blacks People that you on it from yester year who did not get into the halls of fame largely because of none of their prejudice But it was alleged they never really competed at the major league level and in a sense that's true in that the leagues were separate and they didn't have as many players to deal with and possibly the overall level might not have been as high On the other hand they played particularly baseball under such tremendous horrendous conditions playing five ballgames in one day between three or four sites Similarly if you just looked at even something like the prophet Bob Hall of Fame the difference between pro football let's say white pro football and 1930s and pro football in the 1960s and 70s is so different it's just so different between a Model T Ford and a 73 Cadillac So you do have those considerations So then I would like to ask you what criteria did you use in selecting the various people to go into the Black Sports Hall of Fame in the first go round in that well

Speaker 4 00:06:06.680
And it's important that you point out the first go round because one of the things that you must keep in consideration is when you start a new institution and this is what the Black Sports Hall of Fame is you have to have live and kicking bodies so people can really see and feel the vibrations of what this whole thing truly means and represents But the criteria the ultimate criteria that we have use and that we will continue to use is excellence in inabilities to perform the art of that particular sport We also have a side criteria which we like to keep in light of in light of what we're trying to accomplish and that is also guys who have done major things for their race And this of course can be done particularly in sport again But we used excellence and ability to perform as that thing that led us to to induct a guy like Fritz Pollard who was not only a fantastic 145 pound halfback at Brown University but he was the first black American to coach a professional team here in the United States and was one of the first pro stars black or white

Speaker 5 00:07:14.290
The reason why they drew so many people when for example no football Exactly But what about this idea of using a political criterion for a sports hall of fame Is that really a good idea Or am I correct when I use the term political criteria

Speaker 4 00:07:27.470
No you're not correct because I would like not to think that it's a political it's a political criteria that we have used in any of the criteria we would like to think that it's strictly the consciousness that we're trying to deal with of black people that allegation was made primarily pertaining to Jose Torres who one particular sports writer claimed was never a great champion Well I didn't say that he had to be a great champion I said he had to be a great person in his sport prior to Hosey being a champ and he was a great boxer He was a great fighter He was a guy who won the Olympic championship and came back and became the like light heavyweight champion of the world And I think that during his course of his rise from his amateur days to his his title holding which was just one year he was a dynamic boxer I mean he was a great boxer Now of course he was not a great champion but that's not what we talked about It was not a political move on our part None of the athletes who have been inducted have been on the political nature I think if that was the case maybe we would have done just the opposite We would have reacted quite differently because you see one of the major factors in the establishment of this hall of fame is white American corporate money So if we were if we were really trying to be political we would have leaned away from Muhammad Ali and leaned away from Hosie Torres who are pretty notorious guys for their political activism and not so highly thought of in the corporate structure You know as greats good solid black Americans

Speaker 6 00:09:01.610
All right well what about some of the I know you had a number what you might call minor sports and you put some of those people in Is that just to give some recognition to these minus sports or are you really just saying anybody who is a top in whatever his particular field is

Speaker 4 00:09:19.010
Well one of the things that's really important is the fact that so many things get lost as history on rolls and we didn't put in one thing in the press which will which will be inducted and that's bowling because so many people don't realize the impact that bowling has had on this country and the impact that bowling has had on black America that black people used to go in the back door as a bowling alleys and only good ball from 12 midnight to 4 a.m. in horrendous conditions And in fact in 1933 they started their own bowling association called the National Bowling Association because the the the major bowling organization had a white only clause and these people are I would guess about 30 40 thousand strong here in this country and the people who put it together fought a tremendous battle just so that we could turn on our TV last year and see Bobby Williams the first black on the pro bowling circuit So I think that if we're talking about the role of sport in a struggle for Black survival and the role that these individuals have played in making a better place for black Americans and to make the society live up to the creed of the American doctrine then they deserve a niche of recognition for all of their energies and for all of the that the whiplash is that they bore nonsense

Speaker 3 00:10:37.020
The main focus of the Black Sports Hall of Fame is on ethnic consciousness through sports Exam is not intended to be a substitute for people's rightful admission to whatever Hall of Fame exist in whatever sport

Speaker 4 00:10:50.370
Exactly And even though with that we would like to to feel very strong about the fact that everybody was in that hall of fame earned a spot in that Hall of Fame because he or she was truly a great athlete in his time People have some of the criteria that the current Halls of Fame use are you must no longer be active Some I'm almost almost to the point where you must almost be dead you know to try to get in I think that's ridiculous I think that if you look at a guy like Wilt Chamberlain who when you open the basketball record books and he holds eleven records and a nobody ever and I say ain't to be emphatic on a catch Chamberlain and some of the records that he holds he should be enshrined in the Hall of Fame He's a great guy He should be given his flowers why he is alive Another case which is just the opposite is Bob Beeman who has never been a professional athlete but who jumped an unprecedented 29 feet two and a half inches in the Olympic Games in 1968 and ain't nobody gonna jump that I think in our lifetimes again

Speaker 7 00:11:51.900
The nearest people I was I said that when Jesse did 20 said but look at how long you get

Speaker 4 00:11:57.990
I said in our lifetime so that we think that Bob was that that particular act earned him and its niche in the Hall of Fame because it's very unique thing when you talk about Halls of Fame regardless of their ethnic consciousness

Speaker 8 00:12:14.160
And that is what really is a purpose of a Hall of Fame because on one hand a record is as dead as the day it's made Exactly And the other hand the thrill thrill of sport is in the doing of it

Speaker 7 00:12:26.490
But of course anybody who's ever hung around bars knows at least 90 percent of the conversation deals with what somebody did Ben has in Barbershop Yeah

Speaker 6 00:12:38.070
All right let's talk about black sports magazine because that's an intriguing idea

Speaker 9 00:12:43.410
Being a sports fan myself the minute I heard about it I was I may have been one of your first subscribers Oh I appreciate that And I just send it in

Speaker 8 00:12:50.310
But even at that time I identified with and I said well gee why black sports magazines I said I identify with it I go out to buy it To subscribe to it And I say why black sports magazine What are you trying to do that let's say Sport magazine Sports Illustrated doesn't do

Speaker 4 00:13:06.870
I have to admit to one thing first and that is all of my education is in the field of psychology And I went into that field because I didn't really understand a lot about me you know personally and how I didn't like the way people looked at me in the street and why I felt all these inferior things and one of the things that you become painfully aware of is the fact that people are what they perceive themselves to be That we can stimulate growth in certain areas just by presenting that kind of data Well black sports magazine is a as a communications vehicle It's really what it is We chose to do it through the theme of sports because in our community sports permeates every economic level every social level every color level I mean it's just that one silver thread that wins itself through all of our lives especially in the black community we could have started a magazine and called it political now or something and I doubt they would have had the receptivity that sports has in our community But not as many people read it Oh exactly Exactly So what what we decided to do and what we're attempting to do with black sports is to provide a vehicle of communications to the black community about itself center centering particularly around the black athlete and what we are What we're hoping to do within what we think we're being at least us in a small way accomplishing what we are trying to do is to give an extension to that athlete not just his scores and his runs or his hits but to show that he is a human being and that he has problems and that he is He does have the ability to manipulate business and to get involved sociologically in his community in that he is a human being and that he does once the season end he doesn't go into hibernation and wait for the next season to come around He goes on and lives And this is the part of our particular lifestyle that the white sports magazines don't cover at all

Speaker 6 00:14:59.610
Well I think you're right but I would go further I think that sports generically in our society play a socio political role that is different from what it played back in the early nineteen hundreds where it was recreation and it was about the only thing that kept the sports pages going exactly Now sports in America are big business And one of the things that happens is that black athletes do not get their share of all not black athletes black people of running the business of being involved in the business and all the various peripheral fashions And because of the fact that the athlete is really the product of the system to many of our young black athletes get used up by the system don't get their education which probably is the greatest crime in the whole thing And don't get any of the goodies that come along with it Now what does your magazine doing to help alert the public the black public in particular to this consideration

Speaker 4 00:16:02.070
I think there are two phases to that answer One of them has to do specifically with the using of the product the black athlete trying to bring about a level of awareness not only to him but to parents about things like the rip off of college recruiting and don't sign any papers until somebody who has been the college and knows it all that fine print is all about We also try to face that same problem by helping little known athletes A lot of dollars are thrown around loosely to guys who get a lot of ink Kansas call or publicity while we attempt to do is on a monthly basis We take high school and college kids who you don't read about in the sports pages but who are within their own rights Dynamic athletes and we give them a write up We do three of each every month and as a result of it we get called by professional teams by colleges saying Do you know this kid We equate High School in Newark What kind of a kid is he And I met a bad kid Yeah So I always say he's a great kid and I check it out with his coach and say you know you make sure he is a great kid because we just gave him an A plus recommendation The second side to that is there are 66 percent of the NBA and 44 percent of the NFL and 33 or 34 percent of national baseball are black or Hispanic ballplayers The the major press writes about rights to its constituency about its athletes So 90 percent of the other sports books and magazines are about the white athlete There are a ton of brothers out there who are super ballplayers Billie Williams is one of them a guy you don't see anything written by Billie Williams It really isn't true Billie Williams is getting a lot of one now He's getting a lot of press but Billie Williams you know he didn't get the kind of press that he could have I'll give you another example Guy we're gonna do something with right now Leroy Kelly Kelly has been great ball I mean he's a great ballplayer

Speaker 7 00:17:52.230
How many stories you seen about Kelly you say that he's been playing on the losing team for the past five years I have a little something different but we've got one individual effort again OK

Speaker 9 00:18:00.570
A ballplayer I recognize and that's the kind of guy that should be dealt with But you mentioned Hispanic and I've heard some mixed reaction to that on both sides

Speaker 8 00:18:09.860
The blacks say Well Hispanics aren't black and and some of the Hispanics say we aren't black So how do you deal with that

Speaker 7 00:18:17.580
How do you get around those concerns because like you say you

Speaker 10 00:18:21.900
Well we met a couple of guys who say things like that but I'll be very candid with you we have not had occasion to have any Hispanic athlete come to us and say No don't write about me I'm not black The feeling is growing very strongly in the in the total community that people who are non-white are black If you're not you know anglo saxon European origins you're a black person in concept if nothing more even if they put on your passport Cuban in your white we had a very unique incident with Angel Cordero who is probably one of the highest money winning jockeys in the country right now When Cordero goes into the winner's circle a lot of people never notice he raises a clenched fist all the time Now on his passport he is considered white A lot of people call him white He sometimes says he's white but when he talks with you he says I know where my heart is I know what I have to do and I'm trying to represent black people So we have not had very much difficulty in fact we make a conscious effort to put Hispanic people in the magazine and on the covers you know and what we think are are just numbers because they're great athletes Our next issue has our current issue has Orlando Cepeda on the cover and Orlando is a I mean he's a great great ballplayer He happens to be a Hispanic or you say this is one of the problem

Speaker 5 00:19:44.190
I won't belabor this is that some of the Hispanic people do have lots of black blood and identify them as such and some others don't have lots of black blood and don't want to be involved with that And the question is that some people raise Are we just trying to sweep in everybody to enlarge our circle Obviously some of the elements of oppression are the same

Speaker 9 00:20:07.410
But maybe you are maybe you will have a Spanish edition of Black Sports which might become widely circulated in the Caribbean and Puerto Rico and places like that Have you heard about that

Speaker 4 00:20:21.960
Yes we have thought about that But the sales of black sports magazine in that particular section of the world is so high that it gives us any indication that people are accepting the fact that black sports magazine is giving them and communicating to them the kinds of stories that they want to read about the athletes and athletes of their learned about you know and again not to not to belabor it but I have never met an athlete Hispanic athlete who has told me he's way never met you

Speaker 9 00:20:48.590
I'm a little different now I won't name the names because I don't maybe in an hour here Right But what about the conflict that does exist on some teams particularly baseball teams between the black and Hispanic athletes You know I think the ever written about that or it looked into that

Speaker 4 00:21:02.300
We are currently looking into that because that's a very unique situation a lot of times and I'm really flying by the seat of my pants based upon just a couple of interviews thus far but a lot of times it looks like it's a created situation You know it's almost like divide and conquer If you'll notice baseball is becoming more and more Spanish every day And the primary reason is because as the black athlete becomes more aware of what this thing is about he's asking for bigger dollars so they're not signing him as readily as they're going down in the Caribbean and bringing he's not only that many athletes are multitalented and basketball and football have a greater potential lease it's the perceived potential

Speaker 5 00:21:42.090
And if you add onto it the supposed education that they get when they take college scholarships baseball is in a difficult situation a matter of fact baseball unless they do something very swiftly will probably die as a major sport and be supplanted by the more violent sports

Speaker 4 00:22:00.170
I think so And of course you know the other thing that baseball has going against it is the minor league system where a guy goes a college or whatever he does and goes into baseball and he plays in the minors you know for three or four years to do that right exactly whereas football guy comes right out of college and he lets you know he didn't come out of the car

Speaker 3 00:22:16.400
He comes out of the minor leagues which you call college

Speaker 7 00:22:18.710
Exactly And that's one of the things we have to do

Speaker 9 00:22:21.230
That's another part of our right Exactly Well let's talk about another interest that you have which has to do with the use of sports for drug abuse education among black and Hispanic youth

Speaker 4 00:22:32.510
There is a very definite psychological train of thought that says if if I reach your interest level I can teach you anything And of course sports is the thing that is a very high interest in our community right now And there are some very well-run programs around the country where people are utilizing sports to deter the use of drugs There is a little sign that says in essence it says an active sport mind cannot deal with the drug needle you know

Speaker 8 00:23:01.730
So wait a minute now you said that and I agree with that

Speaker 3 00:23:06.080
On the other hand immediately when you said that all I could see was alleged use of drugs by this athlete and that athlete by that athlete and I'm not talking about some I was picked up for smoking weed I'm talking about the allegations that many athletes use a variety of drugs to stimulate their behaviors their performance to help their muscles to grow and so on So when we make a cliche statement like athlete doesn't use drugs and then you see the other thing in the newspaper then you have to figure out how do you balance those off

Speaker 4 00:23:35.690
Well let me just say this Let's you and I not be naive Let us say that sports is a microcosm of the total society exactly And if people are doing it in colleges and in the streets they're doing it and all the pro ranks and all the sports organizations in this country So let's not be fools and say that they are not doing it I in time one of the commissioners stand up say nobody in my organization is shooting heroin or snorting coke He's a fool Let's put it that that coldly What we're trying to do and the thing that we want to emphasize is that we want to get to these people prior to that time We want to start orientated them at a young age at the little league age You know at the Babe Ruth and the Pop Warner League you don't need those things You can play a football game without taking barbiturates and find a means to try and get high to play better

Speaker 9 00:24:19.550
It's very interesting because when this thing came up with NFL several players spoke with righteous indignation But some other guy said Yeah we know it happens and we want to stop it And I gather you your organization and the idea is that yeah you do know it happens but you want to stop it You're really saying that an athlete or anybody else doesn't really need this type of artificial support in order to get through life that's money Something else he can relay exactly sports as much of a sportsman as you are

Speaker 11 00:24:47.840
You know that the thrill of the game gets you so excited your adrenaline get to flow and you don't really need another stimulant or depressant to try and get you into the game I think that Carmen Alexander very aptly put it the other day when he said that a lot of times undue pressure is put on the athlete by owners by head coaches and trainers that he must perform better You know they grade you as a b ball player means that you get 90 percent of your blocks and catch neighbors any passes or whatever

Speaker 7 00:25:13.940
And the moment I leave that's a yes OK They grade you as a as I give you a certain grade I ask that in the moment you blow

Speaker 10 00:25:23.480
They say well you know you're down you're not you're not doing it and the little train has got this little ball in his back back pocket and if you take a couple of these in the second half you'll be OK I know that I know that flu had you down but take a couple is will make you feel better I mean I've seen guys pop 16 pill before the first half was over and then the start the third quarter they took another five or six pills and then they and they didn't know they were too late Wednesday and it for a couple of days after that and of course that's unconscionable

Speaker 9 00:25:49.750
And of course what you saying and I think the approach you're into is a very good one is let's take our athletes those who really understand where this is coming from and work on our person and person basis with young kids on their teams in their communities So they really will understand the realities because you can't really act as though it doesn't exist It does exist And the question now that we know it exists what are we gonna do about it

Speaker 4 00:26:15.070
One of them or one of the most receptive organizations that we've had the pleasure the privilege and the pleasure of working with has been the NBA and commissioner Walter Kennedy We have a program that we're going to implement next month which will touch every high school in America and we'll touch every high school coach and we'll touch every high school basketball player And we're going to try and instill in him through a national game which we played in a major Auditorium on national television in conjunction with the NBA that he doesn't need this kind of thing and we're going to try and create in him the desire to be a leader so that he can't tear himself down by dealing with drugs on that level because everybody's going to look at him as saying damn Roscoe you're a dynamite guy You know how can he possibly not go out and tear his pants and know that all these he's letting down so many people and the NBA has been very receptive to working on a program like this and we just feel so positive this is just a good step utilizing high school basketball on a kind of an awareness and a drug preventative campaign It's the first time it's being done in the country

Speaker 3 00:27:19.660
Okay And I think you've really shown us today on tonight on solar reason just wear black sports magazine is coming from what we're trying to do through the Black Sports Hall of Fame and most recently what you've been talking about about the use of sports as a medium for controlling drug abuse and drug addiction among our youth And I'd like to wish you lots of good luck with black sports and we'll see what happens with the Hall of Fame over the next few years Thanks for being our guests Allen baron of black sports magazine
