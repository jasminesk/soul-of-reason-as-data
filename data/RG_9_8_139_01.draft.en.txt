Flashback Captain Blackman the king that God didn't save the Man Who Cried I Am What are these titles have in common They are all works from the pen of John a Williams one of America's foremost black writers

Speaker 2 00:00:16.760
Hear him discuss his new book Mother Cell and the foxes on tonight soul of reason

Speaker 3 00:00:41.930
This is Soul of reason a program that will examine the roots of the black box soul of reason is produced by BW NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University

Speaker 4 00:01:08.840
With us this evening on sole reason is Jonnie Williams who is very well known for his writing about the black experience And as we mentioned at the top of the show his titles are legend throughout the literary community Glad to have you with us tonight John Thank you And from that very very busy pen in addition to your work is Professor Distinguished Professor of English at LaGuardia College and the City University you've been working on new book which just been published The title is mother Phil and the foxes which immediately leads me to ask the question How did you come up with this name Mother Phil The book is about the relationship between black men and black women and love and so on but the key character is Odell Mother Cell

Speaker 5 00:01:50.750
Now why in the world Johnny Well you get that title

Speaker 6 00:01:53.840
Well I grew up with a guy named Odell That was his first name Mother still is used to be a name of an old seasick remedy I've only met one person in my life who had that name and I was so taken with it that I guess I've carried the title with me for several years

Speaker 5 00:02:11.000
And if you're talking about seasick remedies you're talking about people who are going up and down and then in a way that's what the part of Adele's life is because apparently he was if I can use the expression sort of a super stud and going in all types of adventures with all types of women Okay I'll make a correction He thought he was a superstar right Right Well that really is now Why don't you explore that That basically is what the book is about it's set around Cleveland HOFF section set around New York when it real edge NY you you've mentioned you are building the right could you develop that would you say he thought he was a super lover

Speaker 7 00:02:51.620
Yeah well I'm trying to explore let's say a black male ego in which a man does believe or think he is a superstar

Speaker 6 00:03:02.300
But it's this very ego that leads him into all kinds of traps and situations in which he is ultimately proved to be not the super sturdy 30 with in a sense very vulnerable

Speaker 8 00:03:16.160
Of course he was a professional man a social worker and he got tied up with a lot of other professional types And unfortunately in much of the black professional community we've been sort of led into being teachers preachers and social workers which really means that somehow now that it's expected that we're going to pick up the burdens of a group and solve their problems

Speaker 9 00:03:37.010
And given the fact that we live in a predominately racist society we expect superhuman feats of our professional servants our social workers our teachers our preachers lawyers and then this man mother still trying to act out certain beliefs or fantasies that he had about himself in terms of his sexual potency his ability to make it as it were At the same time undoubtedly he was having some deep seated misgivings about himself as a person Yes How do you how did you develop that how did that come through not necessarily the story but how did that come through in development of Mother Phil's character

Speaker 6 00:04:20.450
Well I think there is one basic premise in that the mother still being a social worker a particular kind of social worker children's social worker could see through his experiences that within this society children were being raised badly poorly so that within his own mind he saw himself as the father of many children who would be raised properly That is to be filled with love for themselves and other people to turn the society around to create a new society And this was one of his drives that got Lost within the superstar ego I had worked with modern day Rousseau in a sense in a sense yes innocence with all the psychological sexual overtones and myths and so on and so forth But it basically is through the children that he hopes to achieve a new kind of world You know I agree with that because I think you've got to start somewhere and it's not with us That's true

Speaker 8 00:05:27.860
On the other hand and he did this in terms of his misadventures or adventures with women he was since tearing down everything he was trying to build because a society with men and women black men and women there has to be a certain degree of mutual respect and understanding in order for not only the present generation but for future generations to develop Yes And if you destroy that in your women and in your men and in your children then the future you're trying to build is being built on sort of quicksand

Speaker 6 00:06:04.130
Yes that's true except that you can't expect these qualities to be in every individual and that's a part of mother still search I agree I think you know we've we've been raised in a culture where a low Love is the ameliorating force for everything I think Love plays a small part in the relationship between a man and a woman But I think that trust and confidence mutually expressed is is really the basis for any goal that a couple would have

Speaker 4 00:06:38.480
Some of the other writers some white writers as well some black writers have been developing that point recently that Americans in particular and all black people have basically an African heritage they have us assimilated many characteristics of American culture have almost a frenetic drive for some type of romantic love and fulfillment of 24 hours a day 352 days a year every year of their lives And as such many of the interactions legal or otherwise between males and females fall down because they don't go to that next level which is being persistent and they don't have any substance to them no substance

Speaker 9 00:07:23.810
And when this gets tied in with political situations it becomes much more difficult You know many of the radicals both white and black radicals have been into situations with women and with members of the same sex based on a kind of love relationship I'm covered with an ideology And then when the love falls apart the ideology falls it's a trend There really is no no thrust that I think seen in terms of several of people who were killed up an addict and some of the other places where as you read their letters after they were gone there was always a searching back and forth for the security Now this raises the interesting question at least to me and I know a number of black men are talking about it now and that is what is the effect of the women's liberation movement on the relationship between black men and black women

Speaker 6 00:08:19.850
I think in most cases the effect is minimal I I think women's limited liberation appeals most to a certain quality of black middle class woman

Speaker 5 00:08:30.370
I love white middle class women white middle class women and a very small minority of black middle class women

Speaker 8 00:08:38.570.0000000000582
In other words you're suggesting as I know some women we've had in a program in the past have suggested that the women's liberation movement really is not a movement at least in its extremes that relates specifically to black women

Speaker 6 00:08:51.680
It doesn't it's like most other movements in America which have been started by quite radical groups does not really encompass the black experience for women or for men And I think anybody who comes out of a black family has some idea about some very firm idea about the position of the female within the society Now that be that that of course stems from the racist situation in this country that the woman had had a firm place and it was not necessarily a place to be looked down upon by the father because very often the woman had to get out and work and bring in her share to keep the family together I think the whole idea of equal respect for both men and women without discussing it too much without too much examination has always been there to a larger extent than in the White family groups

Speaker 9 00:09:56.390
It's certainly possible as we're talking here we are two black men talk right now that say we might well be falling into a chauvinist tea bag ourselves

Speaker 10 00:10:06.340
I know on this because one of the things that I hear as I talk with black women is that many feel that black men do not respect them emotionally They lean upon them They use them They benefit from their enterprise

Speaker 8 00:10:25.480
But when it comes to close one to one relationships that many black women seem to be dissatisfied with the way in which the black man uses the black woman

Speaker 11 00:10:39.170
All our mothers sell in a sense although he had an ideological purpose to cover up his basic psychosexual drive

Speaker 10 00:10:48.660
They don't do that that is a feeling that many black women who are examining the relationship between black men and black women have

Speaker 6 00:10:58.130
Well of course I'm not any more of a position to say whether it's truthful or not And then you my information comes I suppose pretty much the way yours does from well-defined cultural group We rarely get out and deal with the masses who have another view And I think it's one of mutual respect Husband and wife were were in New York which is the isolation and the people we talked to have no have very little relationship to the people west of the Hudson

Speaker 5 00:11:36.290
That's probably true You know there's New York and the rest of the country That's right

Speaker 4 00:11:40.430
That's an irony that among our own or anyone's personal interactions they are in a sense limited to certain groups of people whom you relate to day by day On the other hand you do here and again you have to evaluate very carefully right here when you don't have data that there is a syndrome in some parts of the black community where black men abandoned families

Speaker 12 00:12:07.100
Now it can be analyzed by the fact that the racist society tends to castrate them Yeah occupational lay and and the welfare system makes it important for them to abandon them On the other hand one does have to examine what other First of all what is the truth and to what extent is a large factor Some research I've read tends to suggest that the allegation that black families are falling apart all over the place really isn't any more true now than ever was it

Speaker 5 00:12:38.300
Whereas in certain ends Yes

Speaker 4 00:12:39.690
That's that's my impression these are disappearing type situations But what about that one thing is how do we counter that But does for example a book like Mother still perpetuate this Although he does kind of very tragic end at the end of the book which we will leave leave for the readers to discover

Speaker 5 00:12:58.700
But not a tragic end

Speaker 13 00:13:01.250
No he he

Speaker 7 00:13:02.970
He finds his woman she's pregnant and they've adopted three other children So he has his his work cut out from the start of the new society that he wants to build It's a it's a kind of an upbeat ending

Speaker 13 00:13:18.890
But let me go back to the thing you were saying about what people are talking about women claiming that they've been badly used by by men

Speaker 6 00:13:28.370
Black men are a part of this I believe comes out of the society the larger society is that racist society which is always filled us with with myths the historical record would show that And I'm not saying this to excuse whatever may or may not be happening but the historical record shows and it's continuing today that in terms of this particular society black women have always had the greater advantages than black men Now we can see it in the job situations in New York Let's let's take my my feel

Speaker 14 00:14:08.720
I don't know how many black editors of senior status are left in this city but we have large numbers not well a significant number of black female editors Now when the black literature fed past black male editors went with the Fed but Black females are still with us We also know that historically when it came to a choice of who is going to school and who's gonna stay home and plow the field It was the sister who went to school and not the male of course as you look at that

Speaker 10 00:14:46.960
All right

Speaker 12 00:14:48.320
Sexism does come into it in part Yes men and women generally are lower paid So therefore an intermediate level technical position entry level teaching position et cetera the side is more apt to take the a woman and a man because of unequal pay Now fortunately one of the benefits of the women's liberation movement is to move toward equal pay I think that practically every person regardless of ID and some of the other aspects of the liberation movement does identify with the concept of equal pay Yes work is because that's almost like a union that wants to have one set of scales for blacks and another set of scales for whites It is not even enlightened self-interest to perpetuate that That's one aspect of the movement that I think everybody identifies with and probably as affirmative action and other programs take hold if they ever do we will see more men black men moving into certain positions because no longer will it be advantageous to hire a woman a black woman at less pay

Speaker 6 00:15:52.750
Yeah but we'll have to see though because everybody's gotten so slick right now that in order to meet the regulations it's very easy to hire a woman who who is black and so on and so forth

Speaker 5 00:16:05.920
And you've got two points That's right

Speaker 4 00:16:08.500
Would one aside from the sensitivity that some people are having the general community about affirmative action Well as you look at black writing today and you've used an expression earlier I made an observation that the day the heyday of black writers is past or the period where Black was in his past which I think is consistent with what's happening in every particular field If you talk about black being in you referring to special attention to blacks to help remedy the centuries of oppression and neglect I think that that particular part has sort of passed all along as a result of the initial impetus They are black and many many more feels than they were before but given the fact that publishing companies probably aren't publishing as many black titles they think they've caught up quote unquote What really is happening in black writing today

Speaker 10 00:17:06.339.9999999998836
I mean people like yourself and John Collins and Barack and a few others who are still being published and people like Ismail Reid who are breaking through here But in general what's happening or do you perceive black titles are being published in significant numbers Do you see that readers really want to read contemporary black literature

Speaker 13 00:17:32.110
I don't think they really want to read it This does includes a black readership too because everybody's been indoctrinated with the myth that every black novel is a protest

Speaker 15 00:17:41.830
No that's a very that's a very good point I'd like you to elaborate on that because that is one of the the key problems in black writing You mean the lack of black readership lack of black readership and the stereotype that you Yo that is assume that every black novel is a overtly protest novel Now if you talk about the black condition and we are basically oppressed people dance then anything you write about is about oppressed people but whether it's a protest novel or protest essay or protest poem

Speaker 6 00:18:12.250
That's something that certainly well you see a lot of the literary rules don't apply when it comes to blacks If we had developed in America which we did a great naturalistic school of writing which is writing that shows the effect of the environment and the characters and we come along we do the same thing that's protest If Upton Sinclair did the pit in the jungle as Mills That's that's great muckraking

Speaker 13 00:18:41.280
The rules just just keep changing but the fact is that the the black novel in America has never been of one particular category You could take gene to Miss Kane 1923 and measured against Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises 1926 or whatever There's there's really no comparison in terms of the language the thrust in the whole business

Speaker 11 00:19:05.890
Toma is one of the most underrated of underrated underrated underrated underrated

Speaker 13 00:19:11.820
That's true of writers black all white and that's reflective of the general feeling of criticism as well as a time when he was writing The feedback is obviously that the man did not get that much support I know this has happened with great many writers and the feeling to get that support I assume he just went off and quit And it's it's very hard to stay out there rowing that boat if you don't get a little win they help you especially if the lake is so big You know those white waters but then the black novel keeps changing basic messages are always the same That is the kind of humanity must be searched for and secured in different guises Bill Kelly is become highly experimental very very good stuff Killen's is about as solid as Gibraltar His his theme is always the same You know no exchange but the truths are still there and particularly in his recent book cotillion

Speaker 11 00:20:14.450
He looks at a facet of the black experience with a certain amount of humor and poignancy that can't help but make anybody who read it is laugh right down to his boots and at the same time begin to examine some of the values that come about

Speaker 15 00:20:28.550
And as we were talking before the show sometimes when we begin to explore the realities of black socio political life even in fictional characters the sensitivity of blacks and probably a good reason for it is so high that it sort of discourages the writer from exploring those themes

Speaker 13 00:20:49.060
Well no I think there'll always be exploration and I just just because the Fed seems to have passed this time doesn't mean as far as I'm concerned the end of black writers of black writing will always have them And also we are a very important tributary in the American literature The record shows that everybody steals from us to the Jazz Age The music that was created from jazz music and Stravinsky Hindemith all those people the painters Brock and Picasso of virtual Lindsay then vector and rental for bank carry that up to the beat generation when there was doing the same thing We're very important and I think we know of our importance It's very hard to convince the readers and critics that we are indeed here and will remain well in order for any feel of art to flourish

Speaker 15 00:21:49.400
It has to have some place to grow not only the gallery is a place where the visual artist demonstrates his work The jazz club and the concerts are where the musician does his work The film cinema is where the artist does his work the writer He asked to be published That's right and that raises a question other than the major companies have published books What are some of the outlets We started at New York University this magazine black creation We as I remember has very good has gotten some respect and acknowledgement but right now it's an annual because of just the economics of publication and there are a few other black literary publications around but where can and does the average black writer particularly average young black writer get a chance to get his or her stuff published

Speaker 7 00:22:39.560
That's what it's really all about that's that's what it's all about There aren't too many sources in this

Speaker 14 00:22:44.570
This leads quite naturally to the most pressing need for black writers and it is Black publishers who obviously are not going to play the faddish game Now their number of individual black publishers around the country small hard pressed economically and so on like broadside press and the like like Emerson Hall like third grade

Speaker 5 00:23:10.640
Yeah I the press on And that's one place now where I don't know

Speaker 14 00:23:16.000
I don't think that as individuals they're all that effective I think if they could come together in some kind of consortium publish more books have more capital the effect would be just just outlandishly good And that's that's what I think Black publishers need to start doing now

Speaker 4 00:23:39.110
The largest black publisher of course is Johnson Yes And for years they have continued what was really a Negro Digest black world But again given the nature of the readership like pictures and flashy stories you don't really get a lot of the penetrating analysis even from a large publisher

Speaker 12 00:24:02.300
And to give them some credit I think that Black Widow has published mentioning things

Speaker 10 00:24:06.440
Yes but the extent of which may be some of the really creative things that are being written depends of black writers to get out Apparently they don't get out through our major sources our newspapers certainly don't publish them our little literary magazines like black creation do publish some Yeah It's almost as though these community type activities community publications community workshops do more in the way of getting things out than the major publishing press

Speaker 14 00:24:42.650
Yeah but what put these small outfits do is make the writer hungrier for more and there is There are a few sources where a writer extending himself say from black world to a book length work can go I think Johnson as you pointed out a large publisher has really not pulled the weight that I think they should have in terms of getting good books before the public

Speaker 7 00:25:08.240
But if Johnson broadside third press and so on so forth got together Howard University Press book publishing of Black Books could be helped immensely because it's a real problem because we don't have any real sources

Speaker 12 00:25:26.390
I think it's an important point and also underline something that I found when I first began to do artistic literary criticism people said we first start our television program on black clergy

Speaker 5 00:25:36.440
How are you going to get enough to 30 weeks though Obviously you've got enough to cover 300 year right

Speaker 12 00:25:43.190
And as the more you probe into the depth of black writing the more you find there is available and that puts increasing pressures on the publishing industry I say to open these vehicles and I would concur that places increasing pressure on the black people who are involved in this

Speaker 15 00:26:05.510
Also I if you want to look at it from another point of view I think that more black people as well as white people should actually rather than just knowing the title of a book go to the bookstore and pick it up and read it not just the old standby you know the old Afro-American literary cause yet Soul on Ice and you have young Malcolm and you had some points by Baraka

Speaker 11 00:26:23.750
You had Baldwin and you had Ralph Ralph Ellison the Invisible Man and you had a black literature course now it so happens they are all very fine books but to suggest that you can cover the panoply of American black literary life in five or six or seven volumes is absolutely ridiculous And even anyone black or white to accept the fact that they are educated people with that limited knowledge of the black literary experience

Speaker 16 00:26:53.480
Well you know the peop people are there There's very obvious fact here and that is that the black literary tradition is about as old as the white American literary tradition Two hundred years of course it is And we emphasize people like Phyllis sweetly but there have been other people who wrote and wrote very well about our experiences The other thing is that there are many black writers who write equally effectively about the world at large even though it's from a black perspective Yes there are writers who

Speaker 15 00:27:30.430
An example being a William Worby who frankly every banker who has written for years about aspects of the Black Reconstruction Experience well as a last word on the program

Speaker 7 00:27:44.450
What would you suggest to young black writers who want to get started to write keep writing and to read to read anything everything whenever you can

Speaker 11 00:27:55.490
That's a beautiful way in which to close our discussion I'd like to thank our guest Johnny Williams author of the new book Mother Cell and the foxes for being with us on tonight soul of reason
