This is Soul of reason a program that will examine the roots of the Black Thought Soul of reason is produced by the W1 B.C. public affairs department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University the soul of reason has an analysis of the heart and the soul of the black man's raison d'Ãªtre

Speaker 2 00:00:54.340
His reason for being soul of reason examines black thought thought and art music literature politics religion drama education economic sports and entertainment Indeed every facet of the black man's expanding horizons Now for today's exploration of the soul of reason we have as our guests Mr. Gil Moses director of the new play that has just opened on Broadway ain't supposed to die a natural death Welcome to Sola reason Gil thank you Well this play has already gotten a lot of tongues to wagging and I thought we could begin the show by asking you as the director just what you are trying to get across in Melvin Van Peebles play ain't supposed to die a natural death

Speaker 3 00:01:40.150
What do you mean tongues wagging in what way

Speaker 4 00:01:42.640
Well a number of people are saying it's a very exciting show A number of people some white saying they don't completely understand the show Some others are saying that it's a little too fast it moves too little too fast and they aren't really able to understand what's trying to come across And since you're the director and have a lot to do with establishing the pace of the show I thought it might be kind of interesting to the audience for you to just sort of tell us what you're trying to get across in the show in your role as a director primarily the show is about black love

Speaker 5 00:02:15.380
And I was primarily interested in investigating the different aspects of love that exist in the black community Structurally the show talks about our position in the social scale That is all And when and when you come and see the play you'll see that looking above towering over everything is this perch which a white person with a black watch a black person and a white mask is come visits from time to time And essentially that structure shows that we are colonized that the ghetto was a colonized place and that it is you know is simply controlled for the most part by the by the power structure its ideas its economic system is controlled and structurally on the stage we have shown that the actors sometimes relate to the person who's standing on the perch they send money up to it you know sometimes he drops some money down like a poverty program like a welfare program like Yeah And and and when there's a spark of life in the black community as you see in the last part of the play you'll see the man on the perch with us with the spotlight at which he singles out those people who are creating a disturbance He throws streamers down from time to time which is money which is green streamers which are the economic ties So structurally we've created a situation which shows that the ghetto rather than a myth mythological state of mind is actually a place in which black people have been placed in and unable to move over the last let's say 50 years It's a it's an actual area of land in which has which has not permitted any which the power structure is not permitted in migration from you know now that's structurally in terms of the the characters of the play each of those characters in the play have an incredible Well the human and one of the things that I tried to get at in the play was to talk about the humanity of people the deepest fears of people rather than covered over with some sort of a let's say romanticism romanticism either in terms of glorification of black people or the glorification of nationalism So essentially I simply tried to get at the human the humanity of the people that peoples was talking about and place them in a structure which was easily understandable for everyone I mean make no mistake that we are still colonized And it was an ideas for the most part determined either through reaction or either by reaction or by oppressed oppression by the power structure

Speaker 4 00:05:11.300
Now I understand that play is a series of episodes and one moves right after the other without any particular storyline linking them other than as you say the overriding structure of the play

Speaker 5 00:05:21.260
There is a storyline but you have to come back once or twice to see it Now there is an incredible continuity that goes on throughout the play I mean the play is sort of develops so that the main pawn has focus Yet there are other things happening around it which are lit in different lights which show what's going on so you can follow a character all the way through the play You can follow the progression of each of these characters all the way through the play

Speaker 4 00:05:47.600
Now how did you and Van Peebles get together on this as you seem to describe the thrust of the play and the verve of the plays just so internally as though it almost came from you Yeah I know that was written by Van Peebles himself How did the two of you get together to articulate your ideas and so on

Speaker 5 00:06:08.530
Essentially when I direct I am like a jazz musician I'd take the head of the tune and then play the hell out of it And so when I if I do describe it you know with such you know what a feeling is we simply because it is my

Speaker 4 00:06:25.110
And in other words the You've taken these words advanced peoples road and then you have extended them as sort of an extension of your own personality your own view of looking at the yes

Speaker 6 00:06:37.350
Yeah that's absolutely correct I mean of course Melvin and I talked a great deal But essentially it's the director's job to translate talk into theatrical symbolism or to get theatrical meaning

Speaker 4 00:06:51.600
Well what about the actors themselves particular in a play like this where you're dealing with sort of a pervasive theme I would imagine that the individual feelings that the actors have a lot to do with the way in which they create their roles or are they really responding almost directly to your your lead that you've established

Speaker 5 00:07:11.290
Well yes and no The actors I chose were are incredibly strong and capable people And I chose them not only for their talent but also because of their consciousness You know I feel like the the for the most part the political consciousness of the show is is in direct proportion to the political consciousness of the people involved And I didn't want to I didn't go for actor actors I went for people who were incredibly talented and at the same time had their heads together So we talked about the production a great deal and they through their invention and through with my stimulus you know created the parts and created the whole whatever flow of you know the subtext

Speaker 4 00:07:55.930
Now when you talk about political consciousness you talk in more again of a pervasive understanding of the condition of black people rather than one particular ideology per say

Speaker 6 00:08:07.470
Me Yes and no Now let me get this straight What I mean is one thing it takes a certain amount of political consciousness to understand the attitudes of black people and actors for the most part do not I mean actors generally are trained to be white people right And actors are politically unconscious for the most part I mean after all it's a me individual business and everyone is trying to make it on their own you know And a lot of blackness in terms of understanding what black movements are with black style is the black use of rhythm that's bred out of actors for the most part So when you looking so you're looking for people who are who consciously have not read that out of themselves who've refused to to allow the system to to rip that out of them you know And that takes and that takes an understanding of what is important to as a black person as a black artist So that's first the first the awareness of what is important in the creation of black art becomes important in terms of what actor I choose His awareness you know in terms of political ideology We had many political ideologies within the cast so you know except that one thing was marked in and in the cast was that they were aware that it was necessary for them to be black people you know which is a big step

Speaker 4 00:09:31.290
Now what about audience response obviously in something like this you have both the blacks in the audience and whites in the audience and you know some of the critics for example on the white critics are saying they can't review it

Speaker 3 00:09:44.330
And of course on the black you know I mean dickless thing I have Okay let's hear that You know suddenly you guys you know you know you bring they will you bring Janay here Janay is French homosexual you bring him here and they'll talk about his incredible underworld subterranean thought they're not homosexual no other French you know you bring Tosca here they can't even understand the language let alone the cultural symbols which he's using and all of a sudden they can review that since they can review everything except that which is closest to them well they can review everything but black people know that it's because they obviously a patronizing thing and you know they're being under some of them have been under great attack and they have sort of their response to the attack from some bright black critics who say that a white British can't review it is to say well look I don't know anything about it

Speaker 7 00:10:32.310
It's your thing

Speaker 3 00:10:33.370
But I think that's a cop to the whole point is that no one ever gets to review it as theater one becomes important not only as theater It helps if they would review it Let's say if they would take it seriously they would see that a new kind of theater is being developed a theater that actually translates relevancy as of today into theatrical assemblies A theater that actually confronts society The kind of theater that they've read about in there What their superficial academic you know things they've read about talked about That's what black theater is doing there Yet they can't face it It's right It's like so patronizing You know it's something they don't think black directors can direct they don't think black directors can conceive of anything that would demand their thought They you know was the last play I directed in New York was slave ship Well I read a review of that in TDA You know that the TDA kind of review ran long a very academic right Right OK Stefan Brecht wrote this thing and he wrote it as if he discovered all the things that were in there He discovered the juxtapositions of thought he discovered you know all sorts of symbols He wrote it as if I had like he said the director I mean I can't get over the way he patronized an editor He took with the director and then wrote exactly what was intended You know I mean and it's yeah it's you know only only way we can deal with them since somebody because they have a sore spot with with blacks

Speaker 8 00:11:59.350
Well I think that it comes from two Two points It is true that or by three or four years ago when some of the white critics tried to review Black plays and sometimes they were a compliment or sometimes they weren't half and half or many black critics and even some of the black actors began to say well white critics can't critique blaCk plays I personally think that's really sort of a cop out when a white critic then says Well I'm not going to say anything at all about it because I don't know Now he might acknowledge the fact that he is white and he sees from different on the view but there's still as you say a number of universals in plays which obviously they can comment on

Speaker 5 00:12:44.320
Yeah I mean it's like if you reviewed an OKC play you would review it with the idea of the whatever the culture the language the idea of what the people were about within the structure of that you would within its own logic you would have something to say about it

Speaker 8 00:13:02.130
Now what about the audience reaction obviously in a play like this I would assume that the audience reaction is very very key because this sort of feeds back to the actors and actors feedback to the audience et cetera

Speaker 9 00:13:14.910
I would imagine at least in many of your preview showings you had a large number of blacks in the audience I don't know now that is actually open to the public exactly what the proportion of black and white in the audience is and what the reaction of the audience is

Speaker 5 00:13:31.440
Well we've built a built a whole publicity campaign for black people because we just are directing and our whole attention to black people play was directed for black people Hopefully we can build an audience of black people on Broadway It opens the doors on a whole lot of levels so it sets a standard for community theater

Speaker 6 00:13:50.340
Even you know what I mean as well as permits people sometimes permits playwrights to write for Broadway There's no reason why we shouldn't And there's no reason why we shouldn't write for Broadway and not have an emasculated you know So right now I'd say it's about half and half hour at the beginning however you know during previews in the opening it was almost a 90 percent black in which was really glorious You know fantastic and and their response has been great

Speaker 9 00:14:20.240
Now how how is the Do you notice a difference I would imagine it would be a difference in the white response of black response or can you actually tell just

Speaker 3 00:14:27.490
Well all I feel is that the black audience usually responds vocally to what is going on And so the different things So sometimes is if it's 50/50 the white audience sits there and the black audience wants to respond but can't quite do it because the black audience is like I mean the white audience is like that doesn't understand you know I mean on the other hand you're really talking about life

Speaker 4 00:14:48.540
It's true you're talking about things that no white people really don't know about although with the media and with the coming of certain of our music and certain amount movies more and more the white audience is tuned in to some of the things that are happening in the black community So it would appear to me that part of the reluctance of the white owners to respond is a kind of an inhibition as though they might laugh at the wrong thing or they might respond the wrong thing

Speaker 6 00:15:17.340
That's true too But a lot of white people simply don't believe that blacks are human I mean this is just a fact And I mean so it depends on what stock you have in the inhumanity of blacks depends on whether you respond You know like it's just weird what whatever an audience invests itself in if it has if it invests in southern one thing that makes it rigid and it is unable to really respond to something else You know don't I mean And this audience you know of course a lot of liberals that come you know that that that respond and I'm not ashamed of their response and just laugh out of the place you know But generally I don't think it's so much an embarrassment of not knowing when to laugh

Speaker 10 00:15:58.380
I think it's simply an inability to recognize that what the people are doing can be is exactly what their grandma was doing I mean on a universal on a human level you know they have lesbians homosexuals perms in the white society where lesbians and homosexuals known as every group has gone through some phase of exploring their own humanity Yeah listen Yeah you know it's like ridiculously is what I haven't

Speaker 6 00:16:22.920
Okay white people and and a black reaction is quite similar to me in you know it's a black reaction saying that when I was young my mother said stay away from rhythm and blues you know trashing music right

Speaker 3 00:16:37.050
You know stay away from Henry who lives next door right cause he's a pound per day You know and all the bourgeois people at that time you know we know what the coloureds went through you know Now I think we're going through a similar reaction but it's on another plane And I think that a whole lot of black people or many black people react to the play with that same bourgeois attitude although they're in a different place You know what I'm trying to say is there's a bourgeois nationalism born around me which refuses to admit the humanity or the existence of you know simply because they've had to create an idea of themselves which has very little to do I think with people in the street

Speaker 7 00:17:12.819.9999999998836
Yeah of course one question now that has been brought up and came up in regard to Sweetback as well it doesn't matter

Speaker 11 00:17:19.020
This ain't sweet Back in the day it's right OK I dig it right you're right on that

Speaker 9 00:17:22.500
But what I was trying to make another point and that is in terms of themes the question that some blacks have raised as to how much emphasis relative emphasis should be placed on those aspects of the black life that even though they are part of the life possibly would not be a part of life if the blacks were in total society for example how much emphasis should be placed on pimps and whores and it depends on what kind of theater you're developing if you're developing a theater for the elite

Speaker 10 00:17:51.660
Obviously not if you're developing a popular audience where you want those pimps and whores in there which we do then you better talk about right Well that really is the point The point I think the point is not so much You're saying this is the way all people ought to be But you're saying a lot of people are this way And if we want to relate to them we have to relate to something that they understand in their own life Only way we're going to deal with our culture in any way is to face the things that we're most afraid of in ourselves And being a homosexual or being a lesbian and being a pimp or whatever it is everybody has whether they you know everybody has that fear and we have to face that You know theatre is supposed to be a part as we confront our own selves You know it's not some place that was both a come and be transported to some sort of mythological Nova I'm sorry You know this is what black should be uncomfortable We want to build a strong culture within let's do it but not do it on some myth

Speaker 9 00:18:43.580
Yeah This has to do with the role of theater in the entire culture Black or white Namely the point that you raised about the role of theater to confront the realities that exist in society which I imagine comes in conflict with some other people in theater who think that the role of theater in part is to do that but it also is to extol the more beautiful

Speaker 3 00:19:03.400
Well I see Well I agree with both I mean I know and some plays dictate one method You know each play is different So in another play dictates another method you know at the same time I wouldn't say that every play should end in victory

Speaker 7 00:19:15.280
You know that's beautiful That's really fun for me as a theater go That's what I expect the theater I expect And one night I might have one type of experience another night I might have another type of experience I really wanted to be an experience So I don't want it to be a sham Right And that is really the point of what total theater is about Let's talk about Gil Moses the person How did you get into directing

Speaker 6 00:19:36.850
I started in theater when I was nine at caramel in Cleveland I was an actor right So as I grew up I grew up acting and then I went to Oberlin College at which point I decided that an actor was no longer a possibility for me because Oberlin was primarily white

Speaker 10 00:19:56.580
And I didn't speak my diction wasn't good enough for Shakespeare And also they didn't want a black people doing Shakespeare

Speaker 11 00:20:03.340
I'm sure you did was good enough I think the latter is a real question

Speaker 10 00:20:06.720
You know like you know how you feel funny you know you feel funny because you at that time you're not thinking of doing your tease you thinking of expressing yourself you know

Speaker 6 00:20:14.080
And they were you know and so they had a kind of homosexual theater I don't want a mental me a mentally weak theater second And I don't I was just caught in a previous statement there which I'll explain later Okay So OK So I decided that point at Oberlin that I couldn't get involved in that and decided the only thing for me to do was to start my own groups And so I did it I mean I directed then no longer being passive It wasn't possible for me to act so I directed And it's been two and a half years at Oberlin and went to Paris on a scholarship to study at the Sorbonne And through French you know got involved in theatre literature at least the kind of popular theater when I and I came back to Oberlin and quit and went down south and became was editor for a newspaper there which newspaper the Mississippi free press And and I was a writer at the time actor and at the same time as I did for theater it was happening in my head you know And so let's say in 1963 when I was around when I was 21 I started the Free Southern Theater which was you know about the three southern theater was a theater that traveled to all parts of the South and put put on plays of well off right Right And so from that Free Southern Theater I became I wrote plays and I acted And then I directed and and that's how that's what it was about

Speaker 7 00:21:53.000
Well what about opportunities for other blacks to get into this So you've to really sort of the classic success story you start when you're young you get into it you have an experience here and experience here and graduate work into it now Is this the way most blacks have to get into directing a theater or is it something that a person let's say when he's 19 or 21 or twenty three can decide to get into

Speaker 5 00:22:16.340
Yeah I mean see what what happened was I was very lucky when I was a kid just like Miles is lucky to be playing the trumpet when he was 14

Speaker 11 00:22:23.530
He did you know I was lucky all right

Speaker 6 00:22:25.340
But the Free Southern Theater itself started a whole lot of people in theater you know And since the Free Southern Theater and black arts in Harlem and the east concept E and black arts and you know since all of those theaters in a number of theaters have cropped up it seems to me the best place to learn you know is in a black situation you know in a black community theater that is an incredible stimulus you know if you could if communities could form that type of thing that would be the most the most incredible thing that could happen for the development of now

Speaker 7 00:23:01.280
You say it's that's the best opportunity the best place What is the reason for that Why and why as you say a black community theater is the best place for them to learn Why is that Well I'm smarter than let's say go into formal schooling Oh it is a lot better I mean it's a combination of both

Speaker 6 00:23:17.180
There's very little formal schooling that is of interest to black people I think in the in the arts very little face of interest or relevance or of

Speaker 12 00:23:28.040
Now I mean and I mean should be of interest you know I mean which would be of relevance but I don't know I'm talking about you see black theater and this is something that has recently created been created to me I'm not talking about I'm talking about third world theater the dressing of a black audience sometime there's a definite split know historically through what the black play was trying to do in terms of its audience and it seems as though that that they're not many Regardless of how many teachers there are There's incredible brain drain right now gone out for Black teachers to teach in all these schools But I feel it's almost impossible for these black teachers to have studied what has gone down in the last 10 years so thoroughly that they can you know You know and right now we're finding out how to train the black actor I mean I am you know Barbara interiors in mom who is you know trying to rediscovering that and it's you know I'm not saying that that discovery is limited to us I'm saying that there is a discovery and we do not quite know yet And so the best place for the other people learn either would be with those people who are trying to find out what it is rather than those people who who haven't withstood superficial analysis of what it is

Speaker 9 00:24:41.000
And in those places where the black theater can become a force well one of the one of the factors in development of black theater or any other kind of theater is economics And one way the black community theater sort of bypasses some of those really terrific economic problems and its base right there But then let's assume the actor begins to develop some competence and so on What then about outlets what then about the economics Because I don't know the detail economics of it's supposed to die a natural death but I'm sure that it took a lot of bread to put something like that on Broadway right then

Speaker 6 00:25:15.110
Then it becomes hard I mean it would be simple for me to say we have a blues own place We have to build our own audience You know we have to you know create and maintain our own standards of it you know so that we're not dependent on economically or psychologically or militarily on the white society to determine what we're doing You know it's so that that would provide jobs for us You know I mean to work and as actors and directors not as excuse me not as personalities or not as whatever types that make white people comfortable

Speaker 12 00:25:53.840
You know So it is up to us to establish some sort of system which black people can come into You know and work as people and as workers as artists rather than to me I feel like almost to be an actor director at this point it's almost an impossibility

Speaker 7 00:26:12.990
Do you mean to be one professional area Right I'm doing a number of other things right Because I know a number of fellows a reed

Speaker 11 00:26:20.120
They do records they do stuff for the blind maitre d in a hotel and a few other things that somebody says you know they want to be at ACT as well That's a possible for the get go Yeah a flight director Forget it Yeah

Speaker 8 00:26:32.600
But except that you like it say and the other thing is that you respond to it very very favorably

Speaker 9 00:26:37.760
In other words you are surviving people like you and Bob ran momma a lot number of people are surviving both as actors and as directors which does mean that there is a tremendous future here for blacks in the theater

Speaker 6 00:26:52.520
Yeah there is And I would like to see it however go in a certain way You know I wouldn't like to see his ripped off

Speaker 10 00:26:58.970
You know as we are being ripped off now that ripped off you mean taken off into the major media and right every you know every taken off into the mainstream to merchandise whatever the White person thinks black people should be or merchandise whatever white people think should make money No I hope that our talent isn't ripped off in that fashion

Speaker 9 00:27:21.240
OK I think that's a beautiful point on which we can begin to close our show today You've really told us about the In a sense the heart and soul of a black director Thanks very much Gil for bringing us such an insightful view into the role of the black director how black theater is developing what you're trying to do in your new play as you've taken the ideas which relate to the realities of life of the black people as developed by Melvin Van Peebles in your play ain't supposed to die a natural death which is appearing at the Barrymore Theater on Broadway thanks to go Moses director for being our guest on today's soul of reason
