Speaker 1 00:00:01.170
The black family has often been maligned by academe missions They are often viewed as a cause of their condition rather than the victim Dr. Herbert Gutman has prepared a very comprehensive study on the black family in the United States Hear him discuss his new book The Black family in slavery and freedom 1750 to 1925 on tonight soul of reason This is Soul of reason

Speaker 2 00:00:44.340
A program that will examine the roots of the black box soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University

Speaker 1 00:01:08.640
With us this evening on soul of reason is Dr. Herbert Gutman and distinguished professor and author of the new book The Black family in slavery and freedom and her of this book has gotten really fine critical reception It presents a bleak view of the black family that hasn't been openly presented a widely presented before and I thought we might begin our discussion tonight by asking you exactly how you became interested in studying the black family

Speaker 3 00:01:35.910
Well Roscoe it really began on at the time of the controversy in the mid 60s that was sparked by them what's called them won a hand report that is to say the argument that Moynihan put forth suggesting that the some of the difficulty He never said how much but some of what he called a tangle of pathology what he called a tangle of pathology actually among poor urban blacks in the 1960s had its roots in a long and the history of family disorganization if you remember the language in the report he was arguing for employment But he surrounded it with a kind of vision and version of the Afro-American experience which emphasized that the core of the experience was one of broken families of disorganized families of matriarchy roading it of course in the slave experience and making the argument that norms which were to use a fancy sociological word dysfunctional to everyday life had their origin and slaves could do anything about it their origin in the slavery period and were reinforced by racism and rural poverty and the company blacks into the city in the great 20th century migrations And the suggestion of course was that some of the value system that that was a whole steady process of continual disorganization feeding upon itself that independent at one point he says in the report of what whites were in fact doing to blacks

Speaker 4 00:03:18.420
And of course in the black community this particular analysis was really seemed deemed as an insult That's right

Speaker 5 00:03:24.960
Well those of us in the black community have been keenly aware of the traditions of freedom and uplift and humanity felt that an analysis which suggested that we in fact were the cause of what was happening to us rather than the victim of the economic conditions and the racism in this society let us as academicians black academicians to reject it

Speaker 6 00:03:50.850
And I personally feel that it's really a beautiful window on the world in terms of having some sunlight thrown on this to have a book such as yours that present some information and analysis that goes beyond this cultural analysis that says yes we cultural poverty kind of a construct which of course is the further we get away from it more ridiculous it it becomes what it does is to confuse a consequence with a cause and make it into a cause And it's applied particularly mainly to black people but it's also applied to white people and white poor people I think what was interesting Roscoe is that the black response on the one hand report and the critical whites What was interesting is I mean the report was dealt with on its own terms very decisively at the time it was written I mean it wasn't accepted as fact there was great controversy over that

Speaker 4 00:04:46.710
It still really has not been accepted as fact The problem is that Moynihan was in a position to influence governmental policy That's right And certain governmental programs namely the cultural deprivation programs the programs to bridge the gaps of cultural deprivation I recall myself being involved in the project

Speaker 7 00:05:04.920
And they wrote that in I wrote it out and they wrote it anyway And at that time the money was coming for that And then all of a sudden if you develop a program was based on that you find out that the program is going to fail because it doesn't really is wrong doesn't really deal with the issues that are involved

Speaker 8 00:05:21.030
You also had the I mean whatever the intent the thrust of the whole of that type of an analysis has a very very conservative bias to it that is to say if the problem is rooted in 300 years of malfunctioning it's a very difficult one

Speaker 9 00:05:36.730
And you know programs

Speaker 8 00:05:39.450
I mean there are difficulties which are great

Speaker 6 00:05:42.250
And have a recent origin you have a different perspective as to how to deal with them and I think that that that's another aspect of that which hasn't been given nearly enough attention

Speaker 10 00:05:50.650
Well let's discuss with the audience a some of the central themes in your book about the black family One theme that I deduce from it is that the black family despite the fact that we live in led to believe in large numbers of black families were split up and did not have an opportunity to develop as groups did in fact develop groups And maybe we could

Speaker 3 00:06:13.600
I think the best place to start is to start with Let's talk about the slave family and then perhaps go back Come move it up into the more recent period

Speaker 11 00:06:24.980
The I mean the big finding from which all of the questions flow is the condition the familial condition of black people at the moment of emancipation That is to say during and right after the Civil War and one of that that came early in the study that came very early in a study that is to say my assumption was very simple if there's any truth to what Moynihan and a whole pack of sociologists and social scientists were saying that should be more true the closer you get back to slavery that is to say it's a disorganization one finds in the middle of the twentieth century has its roots in something that happened in slavery the closer you get to slavery the more disorganization one should find and I looked and systematically for a long time at that moment of emancipation when we should see this disorganization at its height because the whatever controls owners had exercised over slaves were released were released and it turned out that the first thing that the important findings are the following I mean on the at the moment of emancipation most slaves and now we're talking we're not talking about privileged slaves we're not talking about whatever that word means when I'm talking about drivers we're not talking about craftsmen we're not talking about house servants so I think we're far less privileged than most people service said several other really privileged That's another story we're talking about field hands and we're talking about laborers We're talking that is to say about the typical slave the typical slave who didn't live never in the big house or near the big house and had none of the relative advantages that skill law Now what kind of status brought this a small number of slaves Most field hands and common laborers came out of the civil war living in whole families intact families

Speaker 8 00:08:18.790
That's clear that they're not cuts at the heart of the whole lot That's after finding out why that happened is really the problem But that cuts right at the heart of the whole problem Not only that but most most field hands and common laborers who registered marriages And here we have an extraordinary record for North Carolina Thousands of thousands of married slaves going to the courthouse to register their marriages in 1866 paying 25 cents which is not something they had never done before I mean the marriage remember was never a legal institution in a slave period So they were acting in New Ways to legalize old old arrangements and what we what turns up in county after county in North Carolina is not only that the typical family is a is intact family but that these are long marriages Let's say half of the people registering marriages are registering marriages that had lasted at least 10 years with no legal sanction whatsoever a quarter or registering marriages that had lasted at least 20 years So here we come to the big question what explains this

Speaker 12 00:09:30.850
What what what And I didn't know the answer to that I mean I had no intention when I first started this work of right out of writing a book about the slave family my intention was to write from the moment of emancipation forward And then there's a vast other kind of range of evidence I mean as a kind of missing persons bureau phenomenon that I mean systematic search for kin and for relatives that's not in the book that will come later in a different kind of a study but a vast record of you know using networks to find brothers and sisters and children and parents and sometimes grandparents cousins moving all across the south through the churches to be sure through the churches and using the churches illiterate people having literate people write letters for them which would then be read in the church the letter would include a description of a child the color as a child when the child had been sold or given away or moved away wholly owned or was where it was probably sold it would be read aloud saying every church in Richmond and the people in the church would be asking to buy know about that child and if nobody knew the letter would be sent at Petersburg or to Louisville And it's a lot of this stuff was crossing all over I mean that's just one right But this going on all over the place How did that come to pass

Speaker 6 00:10:45.270
It's inconceivable that the people who had sold the children had taught to people whose children had been sold to do this This doesn't make sense and it defies any kind of historical historical logic

Speaker 3 00:10:57.510
So you had this vest instead of there being breakup you see and this gets you get real reaffirmation and you'd get reconstruction Not only do families hold together but families come back together with most of the migration and a the so-called disorder following that reconstruction is this kind of a flow

Speaker 13 00:11:15.690
Let me let me leaning forward and backward Let me ask this We have a society which was built on forced labor slavery but we have some general information that says that the planters who own the slaves tended to reward them in certain way so they would work better But we also have some information that says that there is a certain amount of oppression really horrendous assaults on their dignity their personalities their bodies

Speaker 4 00:11:54.540
And then we have some information that says that some of these factors broke up families and spread them all over the South Now to what extent from your data your reading To what extent was the phenomenon of breaking up families a a a factor or a reality or to what extent that mostly families more or less stay together

Speaker 3 00:12:21.330
Well the best record we have I mean it's a right I have more material on breakup in that book than anybody's you had put together So it's not the story of a family's being held together

Speaker 14 00:12:30.690
Of course the question and we'll come back to the question a moment the question is how did slaves deal with breakup Now as far as the size the magnitude of breakup is concerned my guess is that about one out of every six or seven marriages might not families marriages was broken It's a very high figure It's not long now That's right Very high This is a husband and wife separated and voluntarily separated by sail Now of course that complicates the question of how do you reconcile that high figure with what I've been describing about the way in which most slaves came out of Most black people came out of slavery

Speaker 3 00:13:11.490
You also have now that doesn't begin to get to the magnitude of family breakup involving children because all most slaves who were sold were not husbands or separated from wives or wives separated from husbands they were grown children detached from families So we're not measuring in any way the magnitude of family breakup It's very high And it's a continual and ever present part center of the institution especially between eighteen hundred and 1860 because that's well what happened in that in that half century was the involuntary movement of about half a million black people from the upper south to the lowest south

Speaker 10 00:13:55.750
We're talking this evening with Dr. Herbert Gutman who was the author of the new book The Black family in slavery and freedom this massive movement of people one of the largest movements of people in history

Speaker 15 00:14:08.220
I think it's the lot

Speaker 14 00:14:09.360
It's certainly in the 19th century it's the largest forced migration of people in the Western world there's nothing nothing to compare to what an internal migration is just nothing like it

Speaker 4 00:14:19.880
And what you're saying is that during this time this was probably the time when family breakups were maximized Oh sure OK and a terms of an estimate about how many families were broken was it

Speaker 16 00:14:31.500
Most families have a broken there's no way they we'll have it we'll never get it to the point of the matter is that the flow and they insist you know the spread of cotton culture the spread of the plantation system threatened every family So that in fact I mean one of the things I argue in the book is that one of the functions of the family painful as it was was to socialize the child to prepare for that as it grew up as a real possibility Now if it didn't happen the family was lucky But the parents had to teach the child the grandparents had to teach the child and To teach the child and uncle that this was the real world they were growing up and and one of the reasons that slaves managed the experience was because of what they learned in those families about precisely that experience

Speaker 10 00:15:15.810
And of course what you're really portraying very beautifully is the structure of a social institution

Speaker 7 00:15:23.220
In this instance the black family that an able black people to survive because basically I don't know that survival Well all right I like it OK well what I'm developing is that if there had not been this structure the just the health problems the quality the oppression we just cause People just give up That's right And what you say not only did they survive but they and it's created

Speaker 16 00:15:50.370
It's an infrastructure that's created between individual slave and the owner which protects the slave from the dehumanization implicit in ownership Give an example That's a very good point Well for example one of the things that we that we've been led to believe is that the slave father had no role owners for example rarely if in spite of what's been written in recent books owners rarely if ever recorded the name of a father in a birthplace when they kept birth lists These were not kept in Bibles to be sure they were kept in business records

Speaker 14 00:16:23.000
These were asset lists in the same way that they kept would keep a list of you know sales of cotton or purchase of manure or something on increase in horses The worthless rarely if ever records the name of the Father the slave father has no presence in the law as a significant figure and yet slave parents are always regularly naming children for slave fathers We know that now I mean we can see that by looking at the way in which the family system and kinship system worked It just comes off the page not only a slave Son's name for Father's slave daughters are named for fathers Josephine is named for her father Joseph georgiana is named for her father George I mean that's what we begin to pull out of this now Now that's a very that's not an insignificant act That's a very significant choice that's been made by those parents or by the other persons who help name the child It's not it was not clear who Who among the slaves was naming children that were it may have been and like a grandparent was naming the children So what we're getting in other words is a whole range of choices that slaves were making constricted and painfully so painfully so constricted

Speaker 17 00:17:40.490
But within the constrictions a whole range of choices having to do with the process of retaining an identity independent of the identity imposed upon them and asked of them by their owners Now this book deals with one aspect of it I mean with the family and was a kin group it doesn't deal with the full range of choices that slaves were making That's another that's a lot of other books Now what what gives the family the significance that I think it deserves is that the family became the institutions in spite of how it was treated through which over time slaves were able to pass on you know morality as I mean to put it in its most fun you know rules morality all sorts of notions from generation to generation so that the individual slave growing up in the 18th thirties wasn't simply some isolated man or woman cut off and talking to one only because if that's what it was then Elkins is right I mean then you have Sambo it's very easy to make that person into Sambo and that's that would have been the case What you have is that individual slave is the product of a cumulative experience that several generations old by the 18th thirties so that the slaves who are sold into the Deep South and painfully cut off from the world that meant a great deal to them carry with them into the deep south a whole range of beliefs associated with everyday life I mean beliefs about marriage beliefs about sex beliefs about courtship that they act on in a slave way in Mississippi and in Arkansas and in Texas and recreate precisely what they've what they've been cut off from

Speaker 10 00:19:27.140
Well what do you think about the allegation that the slaves were willing accomplices in the planet Germany that they

Speaker 15 00:19:35.720
I don't I have I Well you read my book and you'll see what I think of that That's an That's a construct that's not the real world that the slaves lived in

Speaker 18 00:19:46.310
That is to say that you sent that argument rests on the assumption that the slaves had no choice but to enter into that relationship And it turns out that the slaves had that choice Some did not question and I mean that's not the argument when I'm talking about some slaves I mean what the problems of slaves faced I mean from the familiar let's look at it from a family perspective the problem of slaves faced an individual slave faced as parent was how best to protect his or her child some slaves opted for protection through forming a relationship with an owner That's not surprising

Speaker 8 00:20:19.070
That's perfectly appropriate but most don't happen to 1976 Sure it does but most owners didn't offer that kind of protection in spite of what Professor generously suggests

Speaker 16 00:20:29.570
Most didn't and slaves had other ways in which they could protect their children and that is to say instead of opting for a relationship with an owner they would create relationships with other slaves I mean one of the one of the things I studied that great in great detail in the book as a clue to precisely this question I mean it's not it's not anthropology but social history Other names that slave parents gave to their children And it's not simply that slave children were named for their fathers

Speaker 6 00:20:59.240
I mean that's that didn't have to happen to give Gibbs a larger part in the significance it deserves what's of interest is that in looking at plantation slaves and by the way and also looking at farm slaves I do not accept the notion that we know a lot about the plantations and not enough about the farms because plantation slaves were mostly born farm slaves and when we see them acting as plantation slaves they are acting in ways that are no different from farm slaves What we notice is that on all of the plantations that I studied and studied over one hundred year period in some instances 70 year period roughly speaking about two at least this is a minimal estimate at least two out of five new born slave children were named for blood relatives That is to say were named for aunts or uncles for grandparents sometimes for great grandparents for great And these are all slave relatives Now what what what that symbolizes what that signifies is not simply that they know who the grandparents were or aunts and uncles wives I mean that's that's not what it's about I mean that's interesting But what that begins to tell us is something about the import slaves attached not to the family but to the relations between families And once we began talking about the relations between families among slaves we're talking about kinship not about family We're talking about the relationships between two grown brothers or a grown sister and her brother Now we're talking about how one family supports and sustains another family

Speaker 18 00:22:27.140
And we're also talking about the way in which the death of a parent or two parents or the sale of a parent who took care of that child The owner who took care of that child

Speaker 17 00:22:40.150
No such racket exists That child was taken care of by its mother's sister or brother Now when we start looking at those kinds of relationships we get away from how many slaves live in to most slaves live in two parent families But we get away from that question because it's really a much less important question than what I think and what we're not talking about and what we're also talking about how kinship became I think again an argument is made at great length a great length in the book Kinship became community so that what you see is the development of a slave community out of these networks of blood and marriage

Speaker 13 00:23:21.130
Now did these particular patterns continue doing reconstruction or were they gradually deteriorated resulting in the ultimate situation which we now see in urban America

Speaker 14 00:23:33.310
Well I think it's 38 percent of black families are headed by now that that finding which I think is the central finding in the book has to be studied backwards and forwards And one of the things for example we need to pay an awful lot of attention to is where does it come from it seems quite clear to me on the basis of the material I've looked at that that network that Ken world that develops among the slaves is in no way Amitav imitative of what the whites are doing and that what its origins are is is it

Speaker 15 00:24:07.210
These are adaptive African practices I know there's any question about that just how that happened is something that requires an enormous amount of study but after all one of the things that's characteristic of all in different ways of all African tribal societies is precisely this relationship between families is precisely the following like at home and often the extended family Well with that that's what we're talking about Now that that building of that it's not an African thing by the way when it develops in the new world or in Virginia or South Carolina because it's detached from its African origins it big it starts in Africa if you like music

Speaker 6 00:24:46.840
I mean the same way that jazz isn't African it's Afro American music and the same thing is true with what we're talking about that is to say it's a process that is black history

Speaker 15 00:24:55.660
The black family starts in Africa the history the black family and it becomes something different why it becomes what it does is the way in which African people and their Afro-American descendants innovate and create new structures not to deal with everyday needs of tribal society in West Africa but to deal with slavery and what slavery is doing to them What happens afterward I don't The book doesn't do too much with that That's one of the weaknesses in the book It's perfectly clear that that King World does not disintegrate in the rural South I mean I don't you don't have to read my book You have to just read made sure to see the power of that world in his life I mean that book is just filled with with this with kin obligation

Speaker 3 00:25:39.610
His world is built around kinship in the sharecropping world that needs desperately to be studied and we not only studied in the rural south what happened to that in that migration to the north

Speaker 10 00:25:54.820
The one point that I observed from your book are two things that impressed me greatly

Speaker 13 00:26:00.400
One I enjoyed your analysis about the names and that was something that helps to spread out the whole idea of this kinship network

Speaker 10 00:26:09.190
The other was the reliance on economic interpretations rather than cultural interpretations I am not exactly sure that most people who reviewed the book have picked up that particular

Speaker 15 00:26:21.050
No I don't think so

Speaker 13 00:26:21.910
No I quite agree with it certainly

Speaker 7 00:26:25.690
And as you look at the changes in the family structures and adapted making and what he what is it adapting to what is adapting to the poverty and economic exploitation

Speaker 6 00:26:34.180
I get your take Carol Stark's book all our kin which is certainly the best book on contemporary black ghetto family life by far one of the things that she notices is that is the existence in this terribly poor and suffering world I mean it's not It's a very very painful story in the same way that slavery is painful

Speaker 16 00:26:55.420
What she notices is a range of networks existing in this world among the poor We're gonna talk about public policy maybe what we should be doing is supporting those networks and not the families building to that I mean that's a kind of a it's a welfare it's a welfare state of its own that existed under slavery I can tell you that in great detail and I know it exists it still exists in the rural South The system of risk of reciprocal exchanges that take place between sharecroppers in Holmes County Mississippi has been splendidly documented

Speaker 14 00:27:30.010
Now there are problems however how well that moves into one urban environment is a subject that needs badly to be studied in other words in what economic settings does that work relatively better than when one type of economic settings and another It seems to me that it had to be working in Harlem in the 1920s otherwise want the census data shows would not have would not have turned up something something in the we need We're running out of time and I'm trying to make make a big point and I has to do of course with the last 50 years I want to do another program on that and we'll have to do another program you certainly will have to do another book

Speaker 1 00:28:08.980
I want to thank our guest Dr. Herbert Gutman author of the new book The Black family and slavery and freedom for very incisive analysis of the strengths of the black family

Speaker 4 00:28:19.870
This book brings a insight that is sorely needed for public policy people as well as students and scholars Thanks again for being our guest
