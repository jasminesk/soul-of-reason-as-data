Speaker 1 00:00:01.550
Thousands of acres of beach and marsh land now make up the Gateway National Park in New York How will this new park relate to the black and Hispanic community of New York City Here William Cohen bloom Herb cables and Francis Gibson of the National Park Service discuss the role of this park for minority group people in New York City On Tonight soul of reason This is Soul of reason a program that will examine the roots of the black box

Speaker 2 00:00:50.180
Soul of reason is produced by BW NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University

Speaker 1 00:01:11.060
With us this evening on soul of Reason Three representatives of the National Park Service These folks are involved in planning the new Gateway National Park Bill Condon Bloom Herb cables and Francis Gibson with us tonight

Speaker 3 00:01:26.990
Welcome to sole reason Thank you Thank you All right Could we begin possibly by asking Bill the question what really is the gateway National Park and why is it necessary to have a planning committee that involves people of the type of backgrounds that are with us tonight

Speaker 4 00:01:47.260
Well Gateway National Recreation Area is really the first major urban national park in the United States And it's designed to bring parks to the people from the federal level at least the ideas that the National Park Service has run major parks like Yosemite and Yellowstone the Cascades Olympic mainly out west and in the south And there really has been a need for the federal government to become more involved in a big way in recreation and leisure for the people of the major cities so the gateway in New York is really the first major attempt to do this now for New York as possibly we can describe the fact that the Gateway National Park

Speaker 3 00:02:31.700
As we said in the intro and encompasses thousands of acres of beach and marsh land which goes all the way from Jamaica Bay to Reese park all the way out to what does that Seagate I believe they call it out on the end of Breezy Point out on the end of the island And these were areas that were owned by the city that were bought up by the federal government to be translated into a national park

Speaker 5 00:02:56.750
And as you mentioned Bill so much of national parks in the past have been out in the wilderness And the folks in the big cities don't get much of a shot at it And yet New York City has literally hundreds of thousands of acres of good park land And now we have a national park now possibly hurt you can tell us what the role that you as a recreation specialists will be playing in helping to conceptualize the park

Speaker 6 00:03:25.160
This is something new We've had the marsh land We have reached Reece beach and many folks from the black and Hispanic community no risk beach very well And yet this past summer we went out there we saw federal policemen and we had a few little interesting things happen out there And we found out that it is really a national park So tell us what you about in terms of this planning

Speaker 7 00:03:48.080
Well what I think Roscoe as far as France is in my selves involvement is concern

Speaker 8 00:03:55.070
We're new to the National Park Service and probably we're hired simply because of our urban experience in the parks and recreation I view our particular role as being a very responsive to the minority community I think the sensitivity that we bring to the National Park Service the National Park Service traditionally being Western oriented means that we're concerned with activities within the park within gateway that are reflective of what it is that the inner city people need desire and deserve And in that light we're presently in the planning process of entertaining ideas soliciting the input of the inner city community to help us form formulate the kinds of things that will be most responsive to the needs of the inner city people

Speaker 9 00:04:59.840
Now when you talk about that Francis what are you conceptualizing as some of the needs of inner city people When I frequently hear people talk about needs of inner city people ranging all the way from education to health to recreation I tend to say well done their needs are the same as anybody else They want to live a healthy fruitful entertaining interesting sometimes exciting life Now we have this large massive acres

Speaker 6 00:05:29.030
Jamaica Bay Ridge beach Breezy Point and so on that is now called the Gateway National Park It's got to be the gateway to some things I guess it means a gateway to the shores of New York or what have you

Speaker 9 00:05:41.030
Now what are some of these needs that you deputizing as you going through this planning process

Speaker 10 00:05:45.960
Roscoe first of all I like to go back from beginning and threw up a couple of things The Gateway knife no recreation area of course is one of two There is a Golden Gate National Recreation Area in San Francisco And this this concept was to bring

Speaker 11 00:06:04.890
The National Parks to the masses on both coasts OK We want to hear that Beautiful The other thing is that the lands that we are developing here are former military lands declared surplus OK so there I include the surplus lands from the military Other than just city and state park

Speaker 3 00:06:25.380
This will include the area we know as Floyd Bennett Field

Speaker 11 00:06:28.350
Right That's where headquarters at Fort benefit Then I'd like to point out also that not alone do we have a unit at Jamaica Bay in Breezy Point but we have units at Staten Island and Sandy Hook's New Jersey And the reason why I add upon to that call is primarily my responsibility My partner here Herb Gables is responsible for the Jamaica Bay Breezy Point areas and I'm responsible for Sandy Hook and Staten Island although we've done it

Speaker 10 00:06:56.670
We have overlapping responsibility and we we want we'll be involved in each areas getting back to your question regarding to what the needs are for inner cities what we can probably bring here to the parties I think what we need to talk about is an exposure type of thing for various and all types of programs in which we will be developing at this national park And I'd say many pilot programs also At this point We're not sure what result we will achieve We're not sure how much of the various programs developed and presented at the National Parks will be interesting to inner city

Speaker 5 00:07:41.550
Well let's talk about that because much of the Park Service as you say it's been Western outdoor oriented involving boating and canoeing and riding and hiking and so on Well Jamaica Bay as you know is a marsh lands a good area for watching birds and maybe doing some type of biological work I think they have a high school now that relates very closely to the Bay Area in terms of marine biology

Speaker 12 00:08:10.260
British beach is a beach that as I said many blacks and Hispanics have used for years for swimming heavy into basketball and various games of that type

Speaker 6 00:08:19.710
And more recently they've started this going on the evenings and the like how is that being regarded Is that really what you want to try to do Sometimes folks say what you want to do in recreation is to expand the horizons of people yet on the other hand we have a pop at all this marsh land et cetera and beach land and possibly the highlight activities might be basketball and this going things which can be done right on the block So maybe herb can relate to that question

Speaker 7 00:08:54.030
Yes I didn't want to imply that the needs of the inner city were any different than any other community What I intended to what I'm trying to get across is that we're presently in the planning process which is of necessity required to in the development of the national facility

Speaker 8 00:09:16.350
However what I think we would like to do and what we're hoping to do is to update the present equipment and facilities that the people in the area have come to know and use that to great extent that's the basketball handball and so forth I think however what the National Park also will do for the inner city people is bring more cultural activities into the park in a in a in an area of closer proximity than they perhaps could avail themselves heretofore

Speaker 13 00:09:51.720
I'm talking about drama situations puppet shows and things of that sort

Speaker 8 00:09:57.210
Probably also a lot of instructional kinds of of activities in addition to that because of its proximity to the bay and so forth We'll be into in a lot of environmental programs in historic interpretive kinds of things by virtue of the fact that there is a great deal of history and interpretive information available at Fort Hancock and other military installations that we've gotten So this is the kind of thing that we hope to be able to do immediately and as we go along in the planning process we hope also to be innovative come up with some new ideas

Speaker 9 00:10:42.450
That's you bring in a historical because I know Francis with your beat being Staten Island There's this sandy ground community in Staten Island which was one of the first and probably the largest black oyster Development Community which goes all the way back into the 19th century so that there is something else that we've been working on through our work at the University with the New York City bicentennial corporation that we find that there are a lot of these shore communities which had a lot of black input going back into the 19th century which probably fringe right close to some of your park lands And if you get into that the ethnic heritage approach that certainly is a way of making sure the park more relevant because too frequently in the inner cities it's felt that you know water and ice don't mix right And biology and stone mix and yet some of the premium fishermen and oyster and see seafood industries came out of the black and Hispanic communities right on the shores all the way up and down from South Carolina right all the way up through Rhode Island So what are some of the things that you're going to try to deal with in Staten Island and then the Sandy Hook area because that's a little bit farther away from the Very very concentrated mass It's easy to hop out to Reece beach in Jamaica Bay take subway and take a bus and yet there was a little harder to get to Staten Island even harder to get Sandy Hook So what are the kind of things you have in mind there Francis or Roscoe Course we are involved in some transportation studies and we expect to develop some programs whereby we can bring these

Speaker 11 00:12:35.410
Inner city youth minorities into the Staten Island and Sandy Hook New Jersey area as a result of this But one other thing I like to point out here is that we want to expose the inner city youth and the minorities to the inside at a national park system By that I mean that we want to try to develop some interest in careers with a national park We want to provide some seasonal and part time job opportunities and some exposure along those lines and this is nearing what you saw on tap so far as the national parks are concerned Myself I live at Miller Field My family is there but my family is the only black family associated with the National Park Ed Miller feel are saying Hook New Jersey for that matter So during the peak of the summer activities when I'm making my rounds and checking out these activities and programs then I want to see a certain number of minorities being involved both working for the national park system and then involved in the activities And one of the other hats that Herb and I wear is that we are EEO counselors for the Gateway National Park National Recreation Area

Speaker 9 00:13:47.740
So we're involved in personnel and counseling and working with these young people and the employees here as well as to develop the programs and activities I see and of course that gets into the whole question when I asked Bill Condon bill as a research sociologist with the National Park Service and that has to do with this whole idea the planning process as I hear Herb and Frances talk I hear tremendous amount of professional knowledge and wisdom et cetera And it says we want to do this and we want to do that On the other hand the planning process is one that grows out of the people in the community And it's sort of a two way street that people have to know what's available to be able to know what they want

Speaker 3 00:14:33.670
On the other hand dealing with professionals particularly dealing with professionals from the federal government in this instance the National Park Service it's sometimes overwhelming for the average resident of an inner city community or suburban community that matter to deal with this now Bill how have you and how has the Park Service conceptualize the involvement of inner city residents in the development of the park

Speaker 6 00:15:04.240
On one hand as I said we heard a lot about what the professionals see and I think what they have suggested represents a very positive things

Speaker 3 00:15:13.000
On the other hand if it's going to reach the community the community has to understand and want these things and respond to them And you being a sociologist must have some ideas about this

Speaker 4 00:15:21.850
I have some ideas Well first of all all of us urban France and myself and the other people involved in the planning are totally committed to the idea that the people of the city are really the major resource of the park that unless the people get involved in the planning and the decision making that goes into creating this park of the future it's not going to ever really be successful So in accordance with that idea we have a number of strategies and ways that we're attempting to elicit the response of people in the community first of all of course we were obliged to contact the Community Planning Boards There are 50 or more community planning boards in the city of New York and then there are equivalent ones in New Jersey And we we have a program of going out and meeting with the people who are involved in recreation in those planning boards In effect in New York City Planning Commission has a group which is aiding us in that in that effort And then then we attempt to deal with the people who are using the park areas now to elicit their opinion and to try to get their advice about how things can work For example you you mentioned the Discos at Jacob Reese which were pretty successful up to a point while people were having a good time at the discos and yet the facilities really weren't adequate to handle the number of people who want that kind of activity And we realized it really was an experimental program Mr. Shields who was the unit manager at Jacob reef Park and the National Park Police officials realized that if you're going to do this you really have to invest the money in the effort in making the facilities better than just a makeshift kind of operation So this is the kind of interaction that you get by talking to the people who are using the facilities and engaged in the programs and that feeds and into the planning process Then the third thing and this relates to the other point you made I found very interesting about the oystermen community on Staten Island We're involved with the universities and with many of the voluntary groups around the city to try to find people who will be interested in what the park has to offer and may have to offer in the future so that in involving creating a program of events and historical interpretation in the park we have approached the people that weeks fill in and the preservation group there and we think we approach the people on Staten Island and it's more effective I mean I work with Terry Williams wrote a road at one of the basic papers about the oystermen community the black oyster community on on Staten Island And one of the things we realize there is that the degradation of the environment of New York by the New York Harbor was one of the things that resulted in the decline of that community and really helped prevent the opportunity for black people to continue this kind of traditional occupation on the sea on the water

Speaker 14 00:18:19.600
That's one of the things that I am particularly interested in as you talk about this park know a lot of beach area a lot of marsh area a lot of area where there are birds and fish and so on and because of the concentration of blacks and Hispanics in the crowded sections of the city and because of the limited number of educational opportunities they've had to get into this there isn't that much interest or activity in the black and Hispanic community and such things as birdwatching and exploration of shells and fish and various developments of nature And when you talk to some folks about this you know this talk to you look at you like you had a head because this isn't something black people or Hispanic people are supposed to be into unless they live right on the water and you know it takes a long time to get there Something I haven't been relating to as a sociologist Do you see any particular things that might be done to bring if we want to use these words the black and Hispanic community closer to the nature that surrounds them

Speaker 4 00:19:31.870
I think that the first thing that needs to be done and this will be new for the National Park Service is to relate this whole ecology environment movement to the the actual situation of people who live in a city like New York We have to say and demonstrate that the human ecology is just as important as the natural ecology and that they're all tied up together and related It's for a person living in upper Manhattan It's the ecology of a block or the ecology of how the city is operating where the jobs are coming from Survival of the family is much more important than the birds or the wildlife out in Jamaica Bay It has to be that way and we have to we have to in creating our programs in the park We have to make a combination that that really relates to the actual needs that the people have in their own ecology And then we can then we can begin to show what the larger natural ecology and how it is related to to the more local human acknowledge that may be abstract

Speaker 1 00:20:35.710
But what do you say makes sense I think it makes a very good sense The problem is that as the black community Hispanic media dealt with big government big city government big state government big federal government this usually doesn't happen I get some very positive vibrations of what you say in terms of building on what the folks are interested in and relating it to their own community

Speaker 3 00:21:02.090
But one of the things that I know a number of people concerned about when all of this land was put into the hands of the federal government is whether just ripping off New York and taking things off the tax rolls and so on

Speaker 5 00:21:12.530
And it wasn't going to come back to help the people now I would imagine that herb and Francis have been out on YouTube Bill and talk with various community groups other than just talking with people who used because he would talk of people using facilities

Speaker 3 00:21:28.790
Quite possibly you're getting a view that is somewhat narrow because they're using it and this is what they want

Speaker 6 00:21:35.120
Have you had much discussion let's say her Have you had much discussion with the various community groups in the New York City area about this part First of all is that educational task just to let them know that it exists right Which is one of the things that we are doing here tonight But beyond that to look at their aspirations to look at their understandings of what might be done What are some of the things you've done on that

Speaker 7 00:21:59.990
Very little And it's unfortunate in the short period of time that I've been associated with Gateway I've probably made five to 10 visitations to community groups and one of the things that concerns me with Gateway and with Gateway West is the lack of involvement of the black and Hispanic community Yesterday we had occasion to attend a advisory meeting and it's discouraging when the effort is being put forth by the National Park Service to be involved in those kinds of meetings and find very few blacks and Hispanics represented It's also discouraging when the opportunity is presented to the minority community that they don't avail themselves of the opportunity to become involved in the planning process which ultimately leads to employment and other considerations

Speaker 13 00:23:09.080
And while I might not specifically have answered your question in terms of who we spoke to I would like to continue to address myself to the fact that there are a number of seasonal positions available within the National Park Service there is a consideration and a commitment by the National Park Service to hire minorities within the Gateway project

Speaker 8 00:23:37.100
Historically what happens is that when you go to fill these positions unit managers and people of other disciplines are quick to tell you that the individuals who have applied are not qualified and so forth

Speaker 7 00:23:51.710
I would hope that our appearance on this program and the call to the minority community to get their applications in for seasonal employment at Floyd Bennett would be heeded right now what are some of the kinds of jobs and how does one get their application in

Speaker 1 00:24:11.270
Whom do they call Where do they write

Speaker 13 00:24:13.310
OK they should address their inquiries to the personnel officer Gateway National Recreation Area Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn New York ZIP code is 1 1 2 3 4

Speaker 1 00:24:29.340
Okay could you repeat that call I think it's very important I know a number of people in the audience probably have young people who will be seeking summer employment I might even want to try themselves for this

Speaker 13 00:24:39.830
That's the Gateway National Recreation Area and that's at Floyd Bennett Field Brooklyn New York ZIP is 1 1 2 3 4 the types of positions are park technicians which is a catch all title that talks to recreation personnel laborers and the like first day people clean up the park watch kids writing what and the typical type of jobs you have to be lifeguard

Speaker 1 00:25:09.860
Lifeguard very good

Speaker 13 00:25:12.110
Also there are some technical skills that are of necessity important during the summer That's the skills and crafts and other environmental studies and so forth so that there are a number of good jobs available within the Gateway project this summer

Speaker 1 00:25:33.840
All right now Francis What about community groups that want to have you or herb or Bill come and talk with them about the park how would they get in touch with you How do they develop a communication there But I think that's one of the key things that needs to be done to make this park a viable part of New York City

Speaker 11 00:25:50.830
Yes Roscoe I agree with you and the same number at Floyd Bennett Field as headquarters Should they contact us there

Speaker 10 00:25:59.330
Then we would make arrangements to schedule an appearance

Speaker 9 00:26:03.430
Is there a phone number where possibly they could reach out Should it be done directly through mail Because mail is certainly one way of doing it but if there's a phone number I'd like to see a hotline I'd like to see us use a telephone number

Speaker 11 00:26:15.340
OK All right

Speaker 15 00:26:16.720
And it's 2 5 2 9 2 0 8

Speaker 11 00:26:23.410
Also Roscoe should it be somebody from Staten Island area and they wanted to contact me you know knows I have a Staten Island number which is 3 5 1 8 7 0 0 0 I repeat those numbers

Speaker 1 00:26:37.000
That's important Community groups who would like to have someone discuss the Gateway National Park should call 2 5 2 9 2 0 8 Yes the headquarters has always been a feel of the Gateway pocket Floyd Bennett Field and those that would like to speak with Francis Gibson could call 3 5 1 8 700 on Staten Island right and be able to get a relationship there I think it's very very important what you're doing because unless you develop the relationship with the community the pathway can even come close to fulfilling its potential

Speaker 11 00:27:08.770
Well we have a selling job you see and and I get the opinion that they don't exactly have a real complete trust and in the national park system here as yet So we have a selling job well it might take no years and we may have to start with young people in the elementary schools and wet their appetite and build on it

Speaker 1 00:27:28.570
You know in order to get the message across I think this is a fantastic opportunity for the people of New York It's a fantastic opportunity for the minority community and particularly it's been a challenge to the federal government and it's a challenge to people like Bill and Frances and her to be able to develop this pork so they will be a viable part of the national park system because it is our money We do pay the taxes We are citizens of this country And just as you have Gateway National in the east and Gateway west out and on the West Coast we've got to make this park a very important part of our society I'd like to thank our guest on tonight soul of reason Bill Cohen Bloom Frances Gibson and Herb cable of the National Park Service for discussing the Gateway National Park Thank you for having us You

Speaker 16 00:28:21.610
