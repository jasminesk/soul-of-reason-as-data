Speaker 1 00:00:22.170
This is Soul of reason A program that will examine the roots of the black box

Speaker 2 00:00:28.230
Soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University

Speaker 1 00:00:49.110
Alex Haley's epic historical novel roots has been acclaimed throughout the world Recently the Gambian government sponsored a cultural mission to the United States to help bridge the cultural gap between United States and Gambia particularly American blacks and the Gambians And with us on solar reason this evening to discuss their visit and to discuss Alex's memorable work is Bakari said who is minister of Cultural Affairs Sam County who is a cousin of Alex Haley from the Kennedy clan and Jay Sidey who is with the Gambia news bulletin which I understand is the Gambian government sponsored newspaper

Speaker 3 00:01:29.430
And as we were saying before the show the United States I guess presents sort of an interesting picture to people who haven't been here before or haven't been here a great deal So I will ask you Sam Kent a is this your first visit to the states

Speaker 4 00:01:45.990
No This is my third visit to the states I've been here on two other occasions And what did you do when you were here before my fourth visit

Speaker 5 00:01:55.650
United States was came on a brief study at the University of Maryland College Park and that was the first time that I was exposed to it I just saw two American way of life The second one was a State Department sponsorship which took year and a brief time the United States

Speaker 6 00:02:15.220
Right These is not a trip Mr. said to me

Speaker 3 00:02:18.540
What about your previous visits if any to the United States

Speaker 7 00:02:22.530
I was also at the only university on a fellowship for four months And like Mr. Kennedy I also was a guest of the State Department and I had the opportunity to travel around the states

Speaker 8 00:02:40.470
And I understand Mr. Saeedi from The Gambia news bulletin and this is your first trip to the states And I was really wondering what your impressions are as contrasted with what you thought the states would be like

Speaker 9 00:02:53.730
Oh yes it's my first trip as I just said I find it very exciting experience to come to the United States to have traveled extensively to various parts in the south and parts especially I was uh a bit uh surprise not to find so much of the ratio of segregation of which we have read a lot in the past

Speaker 8 00:03:21.180
I think a lot of changes have taken place now and a small harmony between the races and basically the reason why you expect that to be a lot of segregation is that what the news media had shown and I get say I wish you would read about and seen in the Gambia say in the national and the international press and precisely yes not only in the Gambia in Europe too I was in Europe as a student and I read a lot about the racial segregation in the south and deep south as they call it Well some people feel that the European press in particular and a certain extent African press particularly European press is very hard on the United States by really building up every single incident racial friction to say that blacks are really oppressed the other day I talked with a friend of mine whose cousin had just come from the Soviet Union and a person of Jewish background and went to a city and saw blacks going in in the department stores together and they went to a clinic and a black woman had to go in and she gave her baby to this white woman to hold while she went in to see the doctor and the cousin said well this is not the way United States is supposed to be

Speaker 3 00:04:36.320
That was in the Soviet Union We hear that blacks are completely separate from whites

Speaker 8 00:04:41.310
Now do you think as particularly a journalist Mr. say do you think this is something that the European press intentionally does to sort of make the United States look bad or do you think it's because they really don't know

Speaker 9 00:04:54.000
Well I think there is a lot of uh traumatizing I think of stress Sometimes these incidents of racial tension or racial discrimination that one finds in the United States

Speaker 3 00:05:09.960
And of course we all know particularly those who black Americans that there is a still a tremendous amount of discrimination But it isn't the physical type that we used to have back in the 30s and 40s and during the slavery period when blacks were randomly lynched and beaten upon spat upon That kind of thing But there is definitely a racial segregation and let's say racial discrimination rather than segregation which is a legal phenomenon in the States Have you noticed or have any one of the three of you noticed any incidents or any suggestions that black people are treated somewhat differently socially and job wise since you've been here What about you Mr. said if you notice anything like that

Speaker 7 00:05:50.850
No I haven't been exposed to anything of that kind Because our dealings have mostly been with blacks and the South Boston and Other places We really I haven't myself come across anything like that

Speaker 3 00:06:06.420
What about your observations Mr. Kent as you walk the streets Do you notice anything in particular is

Speaker 4 00:06:10.950
No I didn't Because it's never apparent The only apparent form of discrimination would be a physical one as you say I think it has become a thing now even where people know that they don't see our common ideals and common philosophy They play it cool and rather being hypocritical about it and smile to each other So for a visitor it would be very difficult to notice and I think it's the black Americans themselves who can spotlight this I'm not visitors

Speaker 3 00:06:43.080
I found a very very astute observation All right let's talk about Alex Haley because that's really why you were here and it's why we want to talk to you about not only Gambia but about the reaction that Alex's book has had in Gambia And one of the things I'd like to know is how many Gambians read the book itself recognizing that the book is hard to get and it's all the way across the ocean What about that Mr. said Many Gambians read the book

Speaker 10 00:07:13.140
I think many Gambians were excited about the book Many tried to get copies to read They were not available on sale at the time that it was published But people made efforts True friends were coming to America to bring Copies to read and those who had shared it shared it with their friends Many read I think it's one of the greatest things that happened to come And for this reason everyone felt very proud and wanted to know all about it

Speaker 11 00:07:55.920
What about the television presentation Mr. Kent

Speaker 8 00:08:00.840
Do you really have television in Gambia or do you show these films in the theater

Speaker 4 00:08:06.540
Well we don't have televisions in the guy I saw the films I saw on Twitter and fast for us of Roots was song in the me at the same time that he was being lunch not to states because a group of journalists does a national inquiry from Florida I did this on a videotape and went straight to different

Speaker 5 00:08:26.210
I had had the privilege of our coming to give it

Speaker 6 00:08:30.180
So I would say it was the village of euphoria that for soul roots Well since then when Alex been to the Gambia talks back some themes that I saw in the Jetta on this I saw it in two ways For serialize I'm some Southern session so I invited guest on site and Sessions out for the public Now it is This would have to be given to the mobile Film Unit to solely try to Country House Mississippi Said I think this is advice a lot of excitement about roads as it is in the United States

Speaker 8 00:09:04.060
Well Mr. Saidi how did the Gambian Press respond to the content of roots I mean did they feel that the African backgrounds were adequately shown that they feel that the story of the Kunta Kinte was well told How did the press respond to this

Speaker 9 00:09:24.330
I think it's generally accepted that the story was told in its true context

Speaker 12 00:09:32.340
In fact it's a pity we don't have here a copy of the coming news bulletin in which an article appeared which was published by Mr. CTV who himself is here in this article He tried to clarify his position with regards to the statements made by Ottaway in doubt and casting doubt on the authenticity of the story as told by Alex's informant who is now deceased namely uh Kang Fofana for the audience who are not aware of this

Speaker 11 00:10:10.860
A British reporter by the name of Ottaway released a story in The London Times which was picked up in some of the New York newspapers and throughout the country that some of the sources used by Alex Haley in developing the story of the Clinton plan were really not completely adequate and he quoted the story at least quoted Mr. Selby as saying that he had written to Alex and had allegedly warned him that the source from for fun I was not particularly accurate Could you uh Mr. Sidibe a discuss with us exactly what happened so that it'll be on the air and on the record in terms of what the real situation was

Speaker 13 00:10:55.770
Yes I must first of all say that nobody was warned against coming out for fun Oh I certainly didn't warn Mr. Haley because I had no reason to warn him against when Ottaway came into my office

Speaker 10 00:11:22.110
I was busy preparing to go to Mali on a recording trip and uh I had really no time to talk to him about what he wanted to know He gave me the impression that Alex was coming to London and he was the reporter who was preparing the way for Alex but had been to do for a

Speaker 13 00:11:47.670
And uh talked to care about Congo for finance family and I got the impression that that uh for fun I was not born Creole just for a moment

Speaker 11 00:12:05.610
Could you indicate to the audience exactly what a grill is I use the term a born grill huh

Speaker 14 00:12:12.930
Grill is like a traditional bar person who tells a traditional traditional stories uh family histories and it's a class it's on and they are attached to families to patron families and they record the histories of these families and they have occasion when they sit around and recite these histories

Speaker 15 00:12:46.380
We look to them for the recording and transmission of the oral histories of our people

Speaker 3 00:12:55.770
What is the language that this is transmitted in

Speaker 14 00:12:59.460
It depends on the tribe Because man tinkers have Greer's wall of hungry fool as careers and they will transmit in a language that did not come But the members of which say contest will find unspoken meaning for four nights

Speaker 3 00:13:17.230
It was a Monday in chaos and you were saying that it was alleged he wasn't a born Grill which suggests that he hadn't had the training or the tradition Is that what was intended by that statement No I guess he wasn't looking for blood relationship because for fun I had the training for fun I

Speaker 16 00:13:38.390
Became a grill in his youth and uh crowd the training and was quite good at it

Speaker 17 00:13:47.730
In his time and became a well-known Grill in his life and at the time that I was recording him he was probably nearly 70 when I recorded him He was Over 70 and was not actively playing any instrument but his Stories were still his stories and he was Telling them as Greer's would tell them And I've always

Speaker 16 00:14:27.990
Ideas that you have to become a traditional Greer before your story can be authentic which is just wrong Not only grills nor the oral histories of people elders know it too And in my letter to Alex Haley I tried to make it known to him that we look for oral history from grills and traditional elders And at the time I was writing that letter came out Kanga qualified for both of these

Speaker 18 00:15:14.070
He was a grill and an elder

Speaker 15 00:15:17.980
He was always called out for endless meetings in the village elders give the kind of information that specific like and give you a very clear genealogies They know their families immediate families They know the village well they know the interrelationships between the families very well they can tell you a good to give you a good list of the genealogy grills elders by definition are older people

Speaker 3 00:15:48.510
Does one have to be a particular age to be an elder

Speaker 15 00:15:52.680
You would have to be at least uh very close to 68 70 plus and you would have perhaps to be recognized as a prominent elder in a village You must also perhaps be in a position to represent your lineage and Cuba Kenya for fun I was the head of his family and the head of his lineage at that time as I was saying the clear story as is always more detailed that is the artist's unlike any novelist or writer in your society is capable of expanding a story to show his creativity So also is a grill able to show his creativity what the core of the story which agree hotels and what

Speaker 16 00:16:58.410
An elder tells him would be exactly the same

Speaker 11 00:17:01.930
Well one of the alleged points of difference had to do with the date at which Kunta Kinte is supposed to run away and been captured and according to some historians the situations that were described by Haley in the book really were situations that occurred possibly as much as 30 or 40 years after it was allege that my client was captured now is that something that can really be pinned down that accurately or is it just sort of a ball

Speaker 3 00:17:33.800
I use the term ballpark figure that's an American term for something it's generally in the vicinity Maybe Sam and there's you

Speaker 19 00:17:42.300
I would say is a nice Mississippi that has just pointed out when these people tell histories underlying dies a problem over debts they cannot pin it down to an exact date but they will always remember an event that occurred around Winslow that particular things have happened

Speaker 4 00:18:01.650
For instance I'm Sam Elder Something might have happened the year that Kennedy was assassinated So if you are tall that does and even had happened So when sunset happened and is left with you to get it in time now coming back to the old way if I may mentioned this

Speaker 20 00:18:24.510
That was no reason for Ottaway to doubt care about kind of profiling because the fact is Alex did not only interview or care about kind of for fun when he did he Hard to verify it with the rest of the Kennedys There are five kin to settlements in the Gambia and it happened at the time the LDS county in the line it was in my own immediate family And the story came out kind of for fun said was verified at all levels In fact before Alex went to the Gambia it was a well known fact in the family that had long lines some time in history Some member a member of the family by the name of contact got missing Now my total interpretation of Marquardt always reaction to this story I believe if Rose had not been successful he wouldn't have criticized it The fact that he did doubt and criticize is a clear indication of the structures of roots and also this is an all tactics y tactics to it because the point is roots have done something significant bringing black communities all over the world together with probably he might feel as trapped being what he is and so he would find ways and means of shattering it because I is ridiculous for somebody to start breaking now What was that had been done in 12 years In three days or four days and according to Mr. Siddiqui again you there you find his motive from the very onset was destructive because he paused and purported to be a representative or to be an employee or to be somebody who was interested in what Alex was doing So in fact Miss Ali in his paper he described katakana Fofana as a notorious liar

Speaker 11 00:20:21.540
And I would fear and I would say back that although it probably is the most incredible line all well I can see that it certainly did create a certain amount of concern among you folks in Gambia since that has transpired has it had any effect in terms of getting people more interested or less interested in Gambia I would imagine that one of the reasons for your visit here is to encourage tourism to Gambia And at least it was reported in some elements of the press that significant numbers of black Americans in particular were people all of the world wanted to come to Gambia particularly to Jeffery the village where Clinton was supposed to have come to visit

Speaker 3 00:21:08.910
Now has this had any effect on your tourism and tourism going up Has it gone down

Speaker 12 00:21:14.610
Okay Mr. Saidi I think our tourism is growing up beyond all bounds already long before we came to the United States Over 2000 Americans had indicated the desire to visit the Gambia

Speaker 9 00:21:32.460
Later this year In July alone And by now those figures must have gone up tremendously The interest here in the United States in Gambia is manifest everywhere we went all over it

Speaker 12 00:21:46.030
Is this out in the States and eastern parts of the United States We have been overwhelmed with invitations People wanted to meet us or wanted to talk to us There have been reporters newspapers television and radio wanting to talk to us and then all that springs from the great interest the enormous interest that this book has generated These roots So I think there's no doubt about us ever that we are going to have a big surge of Americans to the Gambia Our tourist official who is with us July the General have been very busy making contacts with tour operators travel agencies were interested in promoting tourists to the Gambia I think it's overwhelming Our problem now would be whether we would be able to accommodate all the Americans who would be visiting us in the near future

Speaker 11 00:22:45.140
What about the ability to free itself I had read somewhere that it was going to be made a national monument or a national historical center I'd also read that I believe it was either Alex or some people related to him where you going to establish a museum there What is the status of that at the present time Sam

Speaker 4 00:23:06.760
Well it has since been declared a national monument and it is receiving careful attention thus planning We don't want to rush things in Q4 We weren't planning to be study and to have long time effects now That's the position as it is I happen to be a member of the relics monument commission Mr said about myself and this is receiving a very close attention at the moment And if I may clarify one situation here This press admission has not been

Speaker 21 00:23:48.490
I have not come into existence

Speaker 22 00:23:50.400
Asked to come and defend Rhodes I think our government had the goodwill after realizing that there had been a lot of indications from American people to visit the guy and yet they feel the American population should be given a preview of Guardian way of life What to expect in the Gambia This is what motivated it I'm not in the sort of to come and defend groups It is with me with and without even groups Anybody who is associated with the history of the Gambia would know that quite a lot of black Americans in America must have healed in that part of the world A clear manifestations of this is James Island just opposite Geoffrey We are the engine for steel start with you and history has it that this place was used as a store to try four times its slaves

Speaker 19 00:24:44.130
So that is leaving manifest living testimony of it and our talking about roots and auto we happened to be only incidental that with the controversy people were interested in and we control light on it And incidentally I care about Maddie for fun

Speaker 22 00:25:00.600
Well for fun as our cousins of the Kennedys and that meant a entitled them to know the history of the came to light it there had been a lot of intermarriage between the Kennedys and the finance all along

Speaker 11 00:25:12.790
And this gentleman in question in fact my elder cousin in Clinton Mr. Silver I believe that you had worked with Alex many years ago because I first heard the story of roots If you want to call it that Alex's voyage into his past in 1968 and he had indicated that he had been working with some of the people in the Gambian Cultural Ministry I didn't realize that maybe you were the person what type of assistance did your ministry provide to Alex in helping to pull the story together It's uh in collecting information around that area about his roots talking to as many different people as possible

Speaker 18 00:26:10.110
Not with the intention of getting them to support Alex's story but also to know what other records there were And I think this was the reason why I wrote the letter which Otto where I caught it The letter was written to Alex to indicate to him that there are other sources and I wanted to tap his sources I wanted to make as many things available as possible and we did that We got in touch with people we recorded them and we sent some of these recordings transcribed recordings translated to Alex

Speaker 8 00:27:03.000
I must say the in terms of the future of the relationship between American blacks and the people of the Gambia Do you feel that some specific things will be growing out of this that will bring those of us those of us blacks on either side of the ocean closer together

Speaker 23 00:27:20.460
Oh yes definitely I think it has in fact already done so because as I have just said the number of Americans who have indicated a desire to go to Gambia and visit so many that we have to travel now of having to to cooperate Overwhelmed by success overwhelmed by success

Speaker 8 00:27:42.610
What about Just as a side as country in the program we've been talking about music and I asked Sam Kent what kind of music do you listen to and I said he listened to Stevie and Ray Charles and Aretha And what did you say about that

Speaker 21 00:27:54.610
Well I agree patronise of just me as a kind of Western music and all that and go to dances and like back at the same time and at home I'm very much concerned with traditional music because Bala fall on like I love it because this is traditional sometimes that I want sort of if that IATA provide me what if I go out into Western culture but predominantly is caught on bellyful and that really is a very beautiful way in which to close the program our guest on tonight

Speaker 8 00:28:27.520
So the reason have been Mr. Bukhari said Obie who is the minister of cultural affairs Sam kin Tay from the Kintore clan cousin of Alex Haley Jay Sadi who is with the Gambia news bulletin and we've been talking about the impact of roots not only on America but on Gambia and the mutual relationship between these two great countries Thanks for being our guest on tonight

Speaker 24 00:28:48.510
So the reason you've been listening to soul of reason with your host the director of the Institute of Afro one African affairs at New York University Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. and featuring a distinguished guest voicing the black experience

Speaker 2 00:29:03.880
Soul of reason is produced by the W NBC public affairs department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University Please join us again next week
