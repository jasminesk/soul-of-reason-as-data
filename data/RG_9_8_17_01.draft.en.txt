Speaker 1 00:00:17.180
The black man is still fighting the United States government

Speaker 2 00:00:21.220
So says Sam Clark in his new record black Americans a record about blacks and the bicentennial

Speaker 3 00:00:28.330
Here's Sam Clark discuss his new racket on tonight's soul of reason This is Soul of reason a program that will examine the roots of the black box

Speaker 4 00:00:58.280
And soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University

Speaker 5 00:01:19.510
Our guest on tonight's sole reason is Sam Clark who has just made what is probably the first record about blacks in the bicentennial A D.C. record called black Americans Glad to have you with us tonight Sam

Speaker 6 00:01:32.230
Thanks I'm happy to be here

Speaker 7 00:01:34.120
Okay we're going to hear the record in its entirety later on But I think it's interesting that you have chosen to do a record about blacks and the bicentennial and the bicentennial celebration because as you know being a freelance reporter and one who covers black thing pretty well a number of blacks are concerned about black recognition of the Bicentennial around Bennett for example in Ebony Magazine says no we should not celebrate that we should ignore it Some other people say no we should not necessarily celebrate it but use it as a time for analysis One sure thing is that joy isn't going to go away

Speaker 8 00:02:14.160
In nineteen seventy six You know as they say on NBC and others the Happy birthday America

Speaker 7 00:02:22.360
So what do you think about it Because it is certainly a serious issue It's not a frivolous issue The fact that America proclaims to be the center of freedom and the fact that black people have been oppressed for one hundred and fifty years before the founding of the country and 200 years afterwards does give rise to some really serious questions about black participation in the bicentennial So what is your opinion about that

Speaker 6 00:02:50.770
Well first of all I'm surprised to hear that liberal Bennett would say don't celebrate it at all I mean I'm really surprised that coming from such a distinguished black writer now and I'm sure that doesn't represent the views of Johnson Publications I think we should say that also

Speaker 2 00:03:07.870
And of course they did run a full page front cover story August covering three points of view

Speaker 7 00:03:14.260
You know we should celebrate it We shouldn't celebrate it or else we should use it as a time for analysis Right

Speaker 9 00:03:21.550
And I guess they did come out with a bicentennial issue They did in August

Speaker 10 00:03:25.570
That's true But Lauren was making a clear point and I think it is a valid political point although maybe not a particularly practical point but yes we really ought to question whether we black Americans should join in this bicentennial celebration So what did you do what are you trying to do in the record I think that's one of the important point

Speaker 11 00:03:43.930
OK Coming from a background in radio for the last five years I've had a great deal of access to statistics broadcast magazines variety publication all kind of money thin agencies And I've come to the conclusion that the black population is a highly audio population They listen to a lot of entertainment programs and a lot of the information they get comes through the entertainment media And I remember once doing an interview with the with the Soul Brother Number One who's now referred to as the Godfather of Soul James Brown another wanted to Brown voice and I said I estimate says Where did you get the courage to do your record Say it Loud I'm Black and I'm proud So I said Don't you think that would finish you in the business He says no And I said What do you hope to accomplish about that He says when I see my brothers and sisters with very little education dancing away on the floor I want them to get some kind of educational message that they could get through to them why they are partying and at the same time I am satisfied and they're satisfied and somehow I'm helping my people So I kept that in mind and I decided that one of the good ways to get history across would be to put it on the record and to do it in such a way that they would listen to it You know it's not a strict narration It's sort of a comparative type of narration I talk about history but yet I make it very contemporary

Speaker 12 00:05:15.610
Well in talking about this bicentennial and black contributions you look at 200 years of history it's a long time one and a short time on the other hand and within that there are a number of areas you can choose distress you can go back to 60 19 Jamestown colony when blacks first came over you could deal with some of the pre revolutionary aspects of black life the fact that blacks were involved in American to your life many of them and gain their freedom You could deal with Crispus Attucks You can deal with Salem poor and revolutionary war you can deal with James Allen and Amy Amy church You can deal with Benjamin Banneker and so on How do you make a decision in terms of a record as to which of these many very very significant things you're going to put onto the wax

Speaker 11 00:06:06.930
Well I'm you know I'm so happy that you said that because my first record deals with history and some of the people and I really stress only some of the black things Some of the things that black people have done over the years you know which is good because if this record meets it some success I can go into part two and part three And believe me there's enough history on the black accomplishments for the four or five hundred years that we've been here depending on your point of view or your the amount of historic information you have that black folks have been doing and I can you know it And you know if necessary I can do an album I can take it back to Africa

Speaker 7 00:06:49.050
Because you made an interesting point namely that the black community is very audio oriented very radio oriented That's right Which is one reason why some of the black stations are so popular back I guess in every city around the country there is a significant black station is very very popular And of course they do play a lot of music Your record is a record which involves sort of a narration over music of a military bicentennial type To what extent do you think this is really going to be played on a black station or the White Station for that matter Because basically it's a message that every American black or white should know about should learn about the world What is the reaction I know this is one of the first times we've really that men to putting this on the air But what do you expect to be the reaction to this record

Speaker 6 00:07:43.800
Well that normally is a sticky question to answer because you know you don't want to offend people that you may have to deal with You see But since we're gone you know we've been on it so far so let's just keep it that way This record is a surprise to a lot of white people when they hear it It's such a surprise the way I compare it and it leaves them with no point to criticize after they hear it they can't say or you're wrong So when they hear it and if they've been in disagreement they now can no longer disagree with something And you're putting a person in the position to to to play something to listen to something that you can't disagree with So it's kind of hot and you must keep in mind too when you're talking to radio stations even if you say black radio stations their own my white people nine times You know I mean I would say maybe out of the thousand or 2000 radio stations in the country we're lucky if we own 50 lucky And I think that's doubtful

Speaker 10 00:08:42.210.0000000000582
And that privates were pretty high Right The question though how do you go about getting a record onto a station

Speaker 11 00:08:49.380
Well your record company takes that You see I'm on the DCA record label here in New York and they have other famous artists such as Gloria Gaynor and others and they have a working relationship with these record companies across the country So it's up to them to talk to the program and music director to convince them to put this on the air and they have to conduct a market study where this would go and I'm confident as it starts to move out you're going to find that white educators will buy this for their classrooms as well because a lot of white teachers teach black students

Speaker 10 00:09:21.850
Of course one thing that the bicentennial has done even though the premise might be a little weak in terms of America a place of total freedom is to rekindle some of the interest in black history We have black bicentennial bicentennial calendars We now have a black by center new record We will probably have a film coming along somewhere along the way We have books which now are beginning to come out that people are looking at so that I do feel that even though the bicentennial celebration might be based on somewhat of a foggy premise as far as black Americans are concerned it is a time where people like yourself and people like myself and others can do something about informing white people but particularly black people about black history So now let us hear this record by Sam Clark black Americans The black man is still fighting the United States government

Speaker 1 00:10:37.160
To enforce its laws that states all men are created equal Well this is one black American who's going to speak out The black man in this country has answered every call to duty He died for America in World War One He died for America in World War Two He died for America in Korea And he died for America in Vietnam Why in fact The first man To die in this country's revolutionary war of 1776 was a black man named Crispus Atticus So why does America say to us We have to wait for better jobs Better housing Better education And now we see the government Overlooking the flow of drugs That are running in the veins of the black kids Whose Fathers sacrifice their lives for this country

Speaker 13 00:11:37.760
Wow Sir Winston Churchill Was proclaiming his finest hour In World War 2 When the Royal Air Force Definite England against the German air force And added that never

Speaker 14 00:11:52.320
Was so much Oh just so you I wonder Did he ever once say That a large number of those pilots And he r a f

Speaker 15 00:12:03.320
What black Well England How much is owed to them Some say It's been one hundred years

Speaker 14 00:12:14.870
Since the black man was three Well I don't know about that But I do know Slaves were brought here for a source of good cheap labor It was so good

Speaker 15 00:12:28.320
That the North started something called the Civil War Well If we are such a good source of labor Why is it That the United States government Hasn't declared war on the construction industry and the unions

Speaker 16 00:12:45.120
For not giving blacks their fair share of the jobs Some people say That we blacks have no right to complain Because we contributed nothing In the way of scientific knowledge That has made this country great Well A man by the name of George Washington Carver Developed several industries From peanut Every time a rich executive Gets heart trouble He should keep this in mind That if it wasn't for a black man By the name of Daniel Hale Williams Who performs a phrase Successful Open heart surgery That his heart trouble

Speaker 17 00:13:35.270
Might be his last trouble And if that Is not significant enough Maybe This is The most Powerful Bomb Ever developed in the world And America's most important project The Manhattan Project The development Of the atom Bomb Was assisted by two black men William Nutt And Junior Wilkins The great faith Of the North Pole With Grace Reached By a black man named Matt Hinson No America is not beautiful Not until she protects All of her people Can she Speak of democracy

Speaker 18 00:14:22.360
Or brotherhood Now don't get us wrong We still love America You know why Because Country Grants everyone the right to the pursuit

Speaker 2 00:14:36.110
Of happiness and that's Sam Clark's new record Black Americans the first bicentennial record about blacks and black history

Speaker 10 00:14:46.940
The record is by DCA records It can be obtained by calling 5 4 1 5 9 8 0 You certainly covered a number of themes of black history in that racket and as I was saying how do you make the decision as to which names you were going to cover

Speaker 19 00:15:02.720
Well I tell you the decisions came out of present day criticism about blacks Some of the things that blacks have been doing What you primarily the criticism

Speaker 9 00:15:11.180
Now we get a lot of complaints that blacks if they're not working they're on welfare and the general feeling is that the week since welfare is there we take it we don't try to go up the ladder If only blacks would go up the ladder there'd be no problem So I figured I want to examine that

Speaker 19 00:15:28.430
There was a time you know the whole concept All right You want to call the shot that we were brought here to pick cotton All right So be it Now that digging ditches and picking cotton or doing any kind of manual labor once you became unionized all of a sudden we lost our jobs Now some people talk about well blacks can't get in the unions because they don't have seniority Well the whole joke of senior it's a joke If you speak to seniority what happens the seniority of the last 400 years Meanwhile you know a foreigner And I do mean a foreigner can come to this country and probably get a job in a union without even speaking English in two weeks And you've been here for 400 years and you still have to prove yourself It's ridiculous to have a demonstration It's ridiculous to have to go to Washington and talk about seniority

Speaker 20 00:16:13.600
I mean just last year you make your point very clearly and I can't I think that's one of the things that comes out of examining the role of blacks in the 200 of the 400 year history of the United States and that is that a lot of the country was built on the backs of black people And as you say that the black people did put in their apprenticeship the thing that I find interesting about the racket Is that it does highlight in very dramatic fashion the fact that blacks have been in the wars they've been in the battles they have made significant contributions in science and in industry and in business as well as the usual contributions in sports and music and and drama that we hear about

Speaker 10 00:16:55.970
And I think it's very important highlight some of those And as you were saying earlier you probably have enough to do an album that draw on black contributions in history or to albums or three albums Right Because we have now 28 million blacks which is larger than all but about six or seven countries in the entire world Right So that is a tremendous repository of contributions and history that black people have gone through it can easily be translated But the question I'd like to ask you Sam because you have been in the media former reporter for WNYC and now doing freelance work

Speaker 21 00:17:36.080
What really can be done to make the mass media more responsive to the area of black history I meant just talking about black people but black history because black history is really such a neglected area I think CBS once did a show narrated by on television by Bill Cosby called black history law straight are stolen And he picked up some of the more obvious stereotypes but that was just a drop in the bucket as it were in a must read up right What can be done to make mass media more responsive to areas of black history

Speaker 9 00:18:10.460
Well I think it's it's a question when we have blacks who know a great deal about black history I mean I just briefly talked with you today and I've learned something even about you And you brought up significant point I don't talk about myself I stay within the present you know Well I think what you've done and I know you want to promote it but I'm going to say it anyway You know being the first man to shoot down a jet airplane and World War Two I think is significant And I don't think you have to parade on it But I think you should have a little section a little biography about yourself and it should be sent out to all the newspapers and to all the communication establishments Now I think to really specialize on this being that it's it's such a problem reaching the media There is a black newspaper association and I think they can get together and just compile a record of that and see that it's sent out now Don't kid yourself Whites some Whites on the very top US MORE where black history than you realize and some of my so aware of it they're threatened They feel they feel threatened by it Let's put it that way And until they get to know it and deal with it we just have to keep it in front of them

Speaker 22 00:19:20.960
You know of course one of the things about black history or about history viewed from a black perspective is that a number of the things that we celebrate in the bicentennial for example writing of the Constitution have very severe racist connotations

Speaker 5 00:19:34.110
I mean three fifths of a man provision in the constitution which in counting bodies for the electorate counted black slaves as three fifths of a man

Speaker 21 00:19:45.460
The fact that the Constitution allowed to continue and the slave trade in certain areas of the country for 20 years after the Constitution certainly blotches on American history which a number of people don't know about and probably a larger number don't want to know about Similarly the fact that black people have always fought for their freedom Actively not just with arms but politically with very astute politicians People like Frederick Douglass for example who were great politicians It's true that many people know about Frederick Douglass but they don't know the work that he did The fact that he was a counsel to President Lincoln the fact that he was the one who really finally got the Union troops to pay black soldiers the same amount of money as they paid white soldiers into the long period of time for that happen Well these are things that are just not covered And then of course some of the more dramatic stories in black history the story of many of the heroes of the Civil War for example or the stories of the heroes of the Spanish American War or the stories of men like Daniel Hale Williams operating in private in hospital in Chicago And you mentioned those are things that that need to be projected but somehow or another they don't get done Not much white history gets projected either except that the media basically reflects what you might call white America Right Oh what does other things that you'd like to see done to make this black history more alive bring it more to the public Well I I I like to see more TV programs That include This Black History and this goes back to Lou earlier point that you were making on an early show of yours that I was listening to where the guest was Cliff Frazier and he was talking about producers in the power that they had Once you see more black producers

Speaker 9 00:21:43.030
Or directors in key positions you're going to see more black history now on NBC on its TV counterpart has a little bicentennial running And I'm sure as time goes on you're going to see little segments on what the blacks have done

Speaker 10 00:21:56.190
And I hope you will Well I should hope that there's one of the points right that license renewal and the pressure of blacks to do The problem with much of what appears in the mass media is that usually black history runs down to Frederick Douglass Booker T Washington Martin Luther King and maybe Charles Drew and the blood bank

Speaker 21 00:22:16.780
And that really becomes all a black history without dealing with many For example most people in America who most black people aren't aware of the fact that there were blacks serving in the United States Senate in 1870

Speaker 23 00:22:31.720
It is I don't know that there were two black serving in the United States Senate and I way of that

Speaker 11 00:22:36.700
Here's something else too You know we we think of integration in terms of what Lincoln did in emancipating the slaves And we think of George Washington the father of our country now This is a speculation history which someone has brought to my attention but they haven't been able to quite document that yet

Speaker 19 00:22:52.900
But I think it's it's speculation on the part of experts so I'm going to talk about it I've been told since my record came out that it really wasn't Integration really didn't begin with George Washington in 1777 all with Crispus Attucks It began with a British general by name is Lord Nelson when he was attacked in America He went to the blacks and said if you fight with me I'll see when the war is over that you have all your freedom George Washington to my understanding as I was told didn't want blacks in our army Washington

Speaker 2 00:23:26.490
Oh now Lord Lord Lord Dunmore Oh you love me too

Speaker 5 00:23:29.560
He was a governor the British governor of Virginia and of course there was a battle between the white British is in no way the American colonialists colonies and Lord Dunmore offered to anybody

Speaker 10 00:23:42.430
I said it wasn't Nelson that day he was the man who applied the seas the Caribbean but it was Lord Dunmore who offered any black who fought for the British freedom and it was that particular maneuver that forced the Continental Army force Washington and is compared to say to blacks all right if you fight after you fight we'll see about giving you freedom actually but didn't know slaves perform all the so well perform like soldiers perform well before Washington considered them a threat

Speaker 2 00:24:13.720
Well was that that accurate two levels on that

Speaker 21 00:24:16.180
Remember that the Revolutionary War covers from all the way up and Connecticut and Massachusetts all the way down to South airline and Georgia

Speaker 10 00:24:25.030
So as a result the basic racist split still existed that the northern states were more willing for blacks to serve because in many instances the colonists paid people white and black to serve for them in the war And it wasn't the classic war where you mobilize an army and they stay in the army There'd be a battle here and they would mobilize some troops they'd go and fight for three or four months and then they would become demobilized and they'd go back to their regular jobs Well many times the merchant and so on didn't want to take time away from this and they would hire mercenaries they would hire people to go and fight for them

Speaker 23 00:25:05.110
And this is where the way in which many of the blacks first began to fight on the side of the north or in the northern part of the revolution whereas in southern plantations mostly blacks were working until in the soil And so as a result they didn't want them to be away from the soil So you get that dichotomy there and Washington just said that he just didn't feel that blacks had the intelligence or the courage to fight Well when Lord Dunmore came up with his proposition several blacks two or three hundred went over and joined him They made him more that made us up to a thousand join the British And with the prospect of gaining a freedom of course a British one Now that put the American revolutionary people right on the spot and they had to come back with a counter offer and a counter offer was that if they fought for a certain period of time successfully that at the end of the war they would get their freedom Actually some of these bargains were well known and not all blacks who fought in the revolution got their freedom Many of them were free and then had to go back to their slave status at the end of the war to try to negotiate their freedom again

Speaker 9 00:26:11.620
But that was the first step sort of any kind of recognition of blacks would you say I would say and in a real sense it was now one thing that from a historical point of view as a historian you

Speaker 23 00:26:22.180
Commentate you should know and that is the Rhode Island blacks a Rhode Island organized a regiment of 700 black soldiers who fought right around York City as a matter of fact some of them actually fought in the Battle of Long Island and fought very courageously I might add Some of them fought the battle of Stony Point So that there is certainly clear evidence in the Muster Rolls and so on that black soldiers fought in the revolution and many of them were free Many of them conducted themselves with great valor probably the number one hero at Bunker Hill was a black soldier by name Salem poor who was extolled mightily for his courageous efforts in slaying the major British Major Pitcairn at the Battle of Bunker Hill So there is tremendous amount and this goes back literally over two hundred years

Speaker 10 00:27:14.740
And then of course the thing that I think we ought to deal with are some of the ramifications of some of the historic things For example it was alleged that the Emancipation Proclamation freed blacks

Speaker 23 00:27:26.680
Well it didn't really what it did was to free blacks in any areas which were slave holding areas where the Union Army took over But it's still allowed blacks who in the northern states were slaves to be slaves And it's still largely how the blacks who were slaves in the south to still be slaves So that it was more of a symbolic freedom than an actual freedom

Speaker 5 00:27:50.660
These are things that really should be cleared up in media now True enough you can't say all of that on the record but these type of things that ought to be looked at This is what our early black heroes an hour later black heroes for example in music feel Scott Joplin is now being recognized because of his fantastic contributions to ragtime and the fact that he his music was used as the basis of the theme for the sting These are little things which collectively can be built in Well as we come to the conclusion of a program Sam what are some of the things you plan to do after this record black Americans takes over Well hopefully if it takes over what I'd like to do is essentially some of the things that you have and I talked about and to bring it other historical perspectives on tape And it is my aim All right our guest on a night soul of reason has been Sam Clark who has just done a record on black history and the bicentennial a DCA record entitled Black Americans Thanks again for being our guest on solar reason Sam Thanks a million Roscoe
