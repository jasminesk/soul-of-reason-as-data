Speaker 2 00:00:46.700
This is Soul of reason a program that will examine the roots of the black fight soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University

Speaker 3 00:01:13.430
Our guest on tonight soul of reason Two very important people and affiliated with the National Conference of artists Dr. Adam Mohler A look by Fowler who's vice president of the National Board and Gene Taylor who is executive secretary And we're really glad to have you both with us tonight to talk about your upcoming conference I understand that you have some thousand people or more who you expect to descend on New York City and particularly the Loeb Center at New York University Somewhere around April 5th through the 8th So possibly Jean you might begin by Well possibly maybe Adam Muller since you have been around since the organization has been established maybe you could tell us something about the establishment of the National Conference of origin and Gene you can tell us something about what's being planned on the conference

Speaker 4 00:02:04.650
Well actually all of this was around long before I was cognizant of what was happening because it's the opposition is 19 years old now Oh it's quite a long time It began in 1959 at Atlanta University and it organized by two very distinguished senior artists Mr. John Mr. Parks Mr. John parks and Miss Margaret Burrows from Chicago And the purpose in the formation of the Opposition at that point was to bring together African-American artists as well as persons of all races interested in art by African-Americans and they felt that in by unifying the forces who would advance the purposes and impact that was necessary for the advancement of black art in this country

Speaker 5 00:02:52.520
It's interesting that this occurred nineteen years ago And as you well know that there's been black art going all the way back into the 19th and even 18th centuries but it's only recently that black artists have gotten sort of national exposure People like Romero Bearden and Jacob Lawrence and Richard but they Hale Woodruff they've been just recently getting the exposure nationally that many of them have had for years inside the black artistic community And it's interesting that you mention Atlanta because Hale Woodruff who was once a colleague of mine at New York University and still active in painting did much of his original work and painting and studying at Atlanta University before coming to New York University

Speaker 4 00:03:39.610
Well you know without a doubt Hale is one of the pioneers In fact I believe back in 1941 He was organizing black artists at that point the national icon the significance of the national causes of why this is this was the first national body to come together but certainly he was doing that to many many years ago now

Speaker 6 00:03:57.560
Jean can you tell us a little something about this conference Reminds me it's sort of a mini fest stacked for those in the audience who are not familiar what we're talking about There is the African Cultural Arts Festival which is going on right now in Nigeria and is brought together literally thousands of black writers poets dancers musicians from all over the world And what you folks propose to do is to bring about a thousand or so black artists to New York City And because of our interest and our cooperation the Loeb student center at New York University will be the place where you emanate from although most of the work will be at the various galleries particularly Studio Museum in Harlem So could you tell us a little bit more about what's planned when the conference begins and how people who are interested can become involved

Speaker 7 00:04:51.320
OK We certainly are very very excited about the conference coming to New York First of all there's so many kinds of events that are taking place The dates are Tuesday April 5th through Friday April 8th and on the first day there will be registration down at Loeb Center at NYU Now the opening session will take place at the Harlem State Office Building that's at West 100 25th Street and at our opening session that we will have Dr. John Henry Clark who will speak on the The Art and the black artist as a historian

Speaker 8 00:05:33.710
And Dr. Clark has spoken at the first regional conference that we had at City College and he's one of our most

Speaker 9 00:05:48.680
What should I say illustrious illustrious persons that we do have and is very interested in what N.S.A. is doing

Speaker 7 00:05:57.740
Also that day we will have our regional meetings and those are meetings that will be scheduled for regions around the country We have I guess basically five regions in which the arts will be coming together discussing the projects that they have been doing during the year and the coordinator regions is E.J. Montgomery from California There's also two seminars which will take place that evening That's artist interaction and symbolism and images and basically those seminars The first one arts into action will take place at also the state office building This will deal primarily with the artists movement around the country What artists are doing from the east the west coast south and the Midwest and north west I didn't think of this too much in detail

Speaker 5 00:06:54.050
All right well let me just raise a couple of questions Obviously most of the people who will be attending will be your members will be the educators art educators artists patrons of the art This program is you know covers a wide part of the Eastern Seaboard including New York metropolitan area and possibly some of the listeners might be interested in attending Do you encourage people who are not members of the conference to attend and if you do encourage them how do they make contact

Speaker 10 00:07:26.530
Certainly we do because we feel that the program is vital not only to visual artists but to interested our patrons as well And also we do we will have a very large student group coming from all over the country so that I prefer the information they can write to the National Conference of artists Post office box 9 2 4 New York 127 Or they may call 2 1 2 8 6 4 7 1 4 7 All right could you give a number again please Yes it's area code 2 1 2 here in New York 8 6 4 7 1 4 7

Speaker 11 00:08:09.400
And that's for information about the National Conference of artists annual meeting which will be from April 5th through April 8th here in New York City Now one of the things that we were talking about for the program was whether people have a chance to see some black art And I believe Adam Ola you can tell us something about that

Speaker 12 00:08:33.169.9999999999418
Well I know we have a major exhibition taking place at the studio Museum in Harlem which is one of our major museum like museums in the country for that matter And we are presently planning several smaller exhibitions at private galleries around the city for one benign girl would be holding a special exhibition And Jeanne maybe you saw me with a few others

Speaker 13 00:08:56.450
Well what we are trying to do now is list is being made of artists black artists that will be exhibiting in museums or galleries at that time Further information can be gotten either by writing to or calling that number

Speaker 12 00:09:14.760
So in other words we'll have several formal exhibitions is sponsored by Nancy and then of course we'll be spotlighting any black on us we're showing the city will be drawing attention to them

Speaker 13 00:09:23.840
Oh also this is very important because we mentioned Hale Woodruff we have Miss Bettina hunter that is working on coordinating an exhibit of his work and I believe that mentioned I was at our Institute's Office where we have one of his prominent pieces displayed and knew that telling me that they were going to put this exhibit together

Speaker 11 00:09:47.330
And I think that's really fantastic because here Woodruff is a pioneer in black art and his work is really symbolic of what we stand for as you develop this conference and the various sessions come about What is the balance between business and social political considerations and just what you might call purely artistic consideration recognizing the business of politics involved in all art but still there are certain times when you focus more on the business than the political considerations and there are certain times that you focus more on themes and media and various artistic considerations

Speaker 12 00:10:27.200
Well we think it can be a healthy combination of all of those aspects We are certainly very concerned with the economic plight of the Odyssey like most specifically in the country And we have making we've been making moves to do that programs and connect up with the proper sources that can begin to devise and implement economic progress for black artists So the conference will have several seminars on art and business certainly marketing all of these areas and we'll be calling in distinguished individuals in the business world who will be working imparting information and guidance in those areas Aesthetically of course needless to say that will be a prominent point conference also because we are concerned with establishing clear understandings about who we are at all times so that both of those are priorities reading

Speaker 14 00:11:24.830
I was going to say in connection with that we have a two session seminar on proposal writing and fundraising which is as he's added what I just said is important to all artists how to get grants how to you know write applications for these and this will be two sessions one in the morning one in the afternoon What day is that on that's on Friday April the 8th And where will that session be held That session will be held down at the Hope Center at the top of the park Both sessions will be held here

Speaker 5 00:11:58.220
I see so basically using NYU Loeb students and a sort of a headquarters where people can come in they can check in they can find out what's going on and then some of the meetings will be at the New York University Center But some of them will be at the Studio Museum estate office building and Are you going to have anything at the Metropolitan Museum of Art

Speaker 14 00:12:16.320
Oh well yes hopefully Right now we haven't gotten a firm confirmation on our panel to be held there and possibly a reception But we do have confirmation for several workshops to be held at Pratt Institute There's going to be a mural workshop in which the artists who wish to participate will be out at Pratt all day on Wednesday

Speaker 9 00:12:42.590
They're going to be on the set

Speaker 15 00:12:44.900
I guess my name and then they'll let everyday you had something into a miracle

Speaker 6 00:12:51.440
We've had many artists on sort of reason I mean we've mentioned people like Benny Andrews and Norman Lewis and this any number of artists Linda Bryant and her work at her gallery Tell me what it was just all of it just about Midtown gallery and one of the things that the conversation always gets around to is the way in which art is supported in America and then more specifically the way in which black art is supported One of the things that was pointed out is that there has been a tendency recently to try to build art into new structures into the budgets for new structures For example recently I believe we had someone on the program was talking about a grant of about two hundred and fifty thousand dollars to the state office building or for sculpture I think that was Andy Piggott who was talking about a grant for a sculpture in a state office building a number of the commercial buildings set aside a certain proportion of their budget for artists To what extent has this really reached out beyond the localized things that the state office building in Harlem to what extent has this new avenue for consumption and support of art reached out to the black artistic community

Speaker 16 00:14:14.630
Well that to that particular clause the I was for me with for a number of years it's been around for a number of years I think spotlight is just being placed on it and what it is is I believe one percent of the total course of any federal or state building in built is supposed to be relegated for it however is not the law

Speaker 12 00:14:32.690
It's a recommendation and thereby it's at the discretion of the architect as to who he would choose as far as black artists being participating in it

Speaker 16 00:14:41.570
From my knowledge it's been very minimal And of course this is following the trend of black artists just being recognized period which is one of the basic problems that we're grappling with with NCA So some inroads are being made as we become more knowledgeable about these things usually a lot of this type information is not available especially to the black water so we're the last ones to hear about it But through our organization we have inroads now so that we received is information and we can act on it as a unified body So I'm hoping that as we proceed into the future there'll be more and more opportunities for black lawyers to get some of these commissions

Speaker 17 00:15:19.950
Tonight on soul of reason we are talking with Dr. Adam Mohler a by Fowler who is vice president and Gene Taylor who is executive secretary of the National Conference of artists and we're talking about black art in general but very specifically their forthcoming conference to be held at New York University and in New York City between April 5th and April 8th Gene as we were talking about the busy this aspect in the proposal aspect and like one of the things that I have observed is that artists in general tend to be supported by people who have lots of money and maybe that's why it's always been throughout time On the other hand I have a feeling and some of the people who appeared on the program a few black people in general and people of average income ought to really support art more

Speaker 6 00:16:13.280
What do you think about that What are some of the ways that the average listener the average one of us can support art particularly by black people

Speaker 14 00:16:22.370
Well first of all I'd like to say they can support us by coming to this conference That is one way because I think the types of information and what we will be doing will not only be educational for artists but to the whole black community areas that we're dealing with are historical Going back to the conference for a moment because I think it's important for us to know historical contributions of black artists and this is one of the segments of the conference that we'll be dealing with And this is important I think for students to know for artists to know and generally for the black community because many people in the black community are not familiar with the contributions that artists have played in this country I think that's important And financially we do have a segment on commercial markets and we do have people that are involved in commercial businesses from greeting cards on to promotion of prints and which means that black art can be available to everyone which raises anywhere in your pocketbook

Speaker 6 00:17:41.390
During the conference will it be possible for people who want to acquire art to acquire it purchase the

Speaker 9 00:17:46.330
Yes

Speaker 17 00:17:47.010
Oh yes the artists in a sense as an entrepreneur almost always there's the opportunity for acquiring art again for our listeners information Those who want to get further information about the conference the annual meeting of the National Conference of artists should contact the National Conference artists by writing box 9 2 for New York 127 are calling area code 2 1 2 8 6 4 7 1 4 7 8 6 4 7 1 4 7 for information about the conference of the National Conference of artists animal you've just in the past few weeks I recently returned from first day in Nigeria and some of us even though we might have liked to have gone couldn't attend both because of travel arrangements and work schedules Tells us something about what happened there and what some of your observations

Speaker 18 00:18:45.380
Well firstly I attended Investec is the abbreviation for the second World Festival of black and African arts and culture and it was a magnificent event It was my first time visiting Africa Nigeria to be very specific and there's no way that I can begin to describe the tremendous influence and beautiful feelings that were part of that festival Black people from every corner of Africa were there from Europe from the United Kingdom and Ireland from Scandinavian countries from the Caribbean from South America and Canada And needless to say it was a tremendous gathering the Were you able to witness it before different venues in which the activity was taking place some of the most profound cultural performances exhibitions Just in general people all coming together in the feeling of unity and to establish once and for the grander greatness of African and black culture One very interesting part of the total coverage of the colloquium which lasted for approximately 13 days and that was very very invigorating We had scholars from every corner of the globe coming together to discuss new teaching methods The straightening out of many historical myths and in general just so laying a foundation for future scholastic and educational moves towards educating black people all over the world

Speaker 17 00:20:32.090
One of the questions that I would have knowing that there are literally thousands tens of thousands of African languages and knowing that basically there is French speaking Africa and English peaking Africa How was the language problem handled

Speaker 16 00:20:47.640
Was it like a U.N. simultaneous translation or did French people speak to the French people in English people thinking they saw that the Nigerian government who the host of the festival solved that by simply declaring that the official languages of the festival was English and French and more or less everybody kind of fitted into that groove

Speaker 18 00:21:08.370
There were interpretations when when for instance doing a colloquium when dissertation or something was being spoken in English she would be translating into French and vice versa So there wasn't too much of a problem in that area usually with each continuing There was some officials who spoke either English or French

Speaker 17 00:21:26.000
And I say in terms of the visual arts were there many actually Sivits other than the exhibits that were indigenous to Nigeria

Speaker 18 00:21:35.580
Oh absolutely it was an international forum There you had exhibitions from all of the nations who participated And I can proudly say that the black American exhibition certainly stood as one of the finest I had heard that the Jacob Lawrence either was there or sent a major exhibit of his work

Speaker 16 00:21:53.970
Well he did some one piece And yes that made you very well may have been had one day also Mr. Critchlow was represented also

Speaker 19 00:22:03.090
And you had a very good cross-section of what about in areas other than the visual arts I understand that one of the problems that did occur is that everyone stayed A lot of people stayed in what was known as FEST a village which was somewhat outside of Lagos which is the main city And there was a real question of how do you get around and how do you juggle all of these things How did that work

Speaker 16 00:22:25.350
Well let's see Number one I'd like to mention that the exhibit by the way was comprised of a great number of NCA artists from all over the country As far as the transportation the Nigerian government must give special commendations went out of their way to make things feasible as possible and large buses were assigned each contingent and several smaller buses and cars However you when you were dealing with 250 American people would for you know six to seven buses It got to be a little tricky However I will say that most people were able move around Transportation was provided to the areas where activities were going on perhaps people did not move about as freely as they wanted which was to get outside of legal since some of the other cities in Nigeria but certainly provisions were made for transportation

Speaker 20 00:23:15.880
No no question about it One of my themes What are some of the main maybe gene you might want to respond to this What are some of the main themes in contemporary Bangkok We just heard from Adam Moeller about African influence and concerns about affecting the black experience What are today the main themes in black art We know that eight years ago there was a lot of protest involved in some of the themes Are there more attempts to reflect African heritage or are there more attempts to let artists do their own thing in terms of whatever medium or whatever message for or whatever feeling because the artist doesn't necessarily have to have a message

Speaker 21 00:24:06.660
That's a loaded question That's why I was smiling because this is a question that is asked a lot is asked a lot

Speaker 9 00:24:18.030
Yes

Speaker 22 00:24:18.600
And it seems to come up at every conference either as a part of a seminar or workshop or in the gathering of artists when they meet say on the basis of five to six people this is always one of the points of controversy So I wanted to answer your question I would say that artists are dealing with maybe I could say three levels And that's one of taking from our African tradition and incorporating that into our work I think artists are very concerned about getting back to our roots and finding out more about our heritage I also feel that with that we have a large segment of artists that are concerned about expressing themselves And that's a very broad general statement And by doing that they're also taking into consideration I would imagine being or being born in this country being Western and so may or may not want to deal with that but that's also reality

Speaker 11 00:25:42.210
In other way what you really are saying as I hear you Is that like any set of artists black artists reflect a wide range of cultural experience that has some roots in their basic origin which is African and Afro-American and in the sense that it's a loaded question I recognize that when I ask it and is one that has been going on for many years how about any kind of art Yeah

Speaker 12 00:26:06.930
It's been a it's been a bit of question since the so-called Negro Renaissance in the 20s as to what black that so So it is something that is being worked out and I think artists are becoming a little more broad minded about the whole concept The most rewarding thing I found in the years these current years is that more also becoming aware of themselves as black people and thereby would reflect at some point in their work which is very significant

Speaker 19 00:26:32.580
That's an interesting point because there are some artists black artists who paint what they call the traditional motif you know showing pictures events and so on At least as I view this as a person who attempts to appreciate art a it doesn't have to do any one particular thing so long as the black artist reflects what he or she feels is a part of the experience and the emotion and the aesthetic that she wants to present And in terms of dealing with this most probably it will reflect some aspect of one's black experience One thing that we didn't mention is that at your conference the National Conference of artists the annual meeting you will have some of the people who are talking about these very things Ramya Britain for example which is one of our most esteemed black artists will appear at the conference And in terms of the media Tony Brown is a producer of Black Journal for any team will also appear and I'm sure many of the other people whom we've mention here for example I noticed in one of your newsletters that Elizabeth Catlett had just completed a piece on Louis Armstrong in New Orleans Like you mentioned

Speaker 12 00:27:50.060
So I think it's very important that someone come in his cover should not feel that they're only going to be dealing with visual ideas even though that is the main theme you're going to have artists and creators from all different disciplines because one of the things that we're pushing is the interaction between the Visual Sciences and all of the other medias And so he will have a broad cross-section of creative people here which should be very invigorating

Speaker 11 00:28:13.110
