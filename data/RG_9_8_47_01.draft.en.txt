Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University

Speaker 3 00:01:01.420
Our guest on sole reason tonight is Dean messenger former New York Knick and now Atlanta Hawks basketball star Dean is a member of the board of the Sports Foundation which is a Harlem based youth organization and also contributes to a variety of causes in both the black Hispanic and the overall New York City community

Speaker 1 00:01:20.590
Glad to have you with us tonight Dean Thank you

Speaker 4 00:01:22.360
Dr. Brown Well we you woke up a few weeks ago and found out that you had been treated as all athletes off from time to time from the New York Knicks to the Atlanta Hawks and you were such a favorite in New York both because of your community service but also because of your dynamic play and your enthusiasm and your intelligence that a lot of New Yorkers were really sorry to see you go at the same time you are now going to a new city a city which is a large black population a black mayor and is a place which is often called the New York of the South So what are some of your reactions to being traded What are some of the things you look forward to in your new career in Atlanta

Speaker 5 00:02:08.139.99999999998545
Well Dr. Brown When I found out initially Red Holzman called me in by 11:00 or 5:00 in the morning

Speaker 6 00:02:13.570
You remember the time I would attack because I was just getting out of bed What's he called me

Speaker 5 00:02:20.800
I knew it was happening because the fact that I think I confronted the problem prior to that like two months before the season and then confirmed the problem I think I resolved the problem and since that I realize there are certain people that was necessitated to build a new york system in like I was I wasn't one of those people I realized that redhead in a man's we had to take certain people like Walt Earl Bill Bradley Phil Jackson John Janelle and Willis Reed and subsequently I think he had to take a Mel Davis because Mel is when his upcoming stars especially frontline and head for healthy got so fouls place in the same situation I would have put Henry Bibb in the amendments and an expansion draft too and therefore New Orleans Atlantic and only pick like one of the guys and he still has three healthy God so business wise and from from professional perspective I think Ray did the best thing he could I feel that I don't miss playing basketball per say New York but what I miss is the social and personal aspects of my life I've been involved in a lot of community programs and I've just been involved in New York City as a whole and I just think professionally speaking that this is the biggest break in my career I just think I have to make the most of it and go apply myself and use all my energies to watch me going to law school and basketball become a basketball freak again

Speaker 4 00:03:53.480
It's very interesting what you said dramatizes very clearly both the charm and the intelligence have been mentioned here the fact that you can evaluate so clearly the alternatives that the management had and where is not necessarily being ecstatic about it happening Taking it as a challenge recognizing why it happened and setting some new goals and some new plateaus to strike for And that's part of being manager and that's part of the type of thing that I particularly and a number of people in the black community liked about what's happening to some of our younger black athletes the intelligence the persistence the drive the willingness to strike out into new ventures

Speaker 5 00:04:39.520
What would definitely Roscoe I think the Times can pass where athlete can be ignorant of a lot of facts of life not distant professional sports but in the world I think he has to be a tall person because he's in a position to influence a lot of people especially black athletes who young kids aspire to be like because if one of the few miles that kids can emulate and I feel that we're in a position that we have influence upon a lot of people and we have to use use that influence positively in the sense that we have to get involved in programs and I think we have to instill in young people that athletics especially on amateur level

Speaker 7 00:05:17.870
I don't know what you want to call when you start and then that probably ends that little gravel road now

Speaker 6 00:05:26.840
I think we have to instill in these young youngsters the fact that basketball is just a means to an end and it's not an end in itself I think sports in general is good and it helps to scouts reporting communications among people and help people to realize that hey we're in a world together and to make this a better world We have to develop new value systems and build devices because I think is is where is the individual that things start

Speaker 5 00:05:53.610
But it's not just external structure society you know as long as we are confused individually and we're mixed up and we have mixed emotions about certain issues and certain problems that we confront in life I think the external structures of society will reflect what we are internally

Speaker 4 00:06:09.510
Now you mentioned earlier that you were thinking about going to law school and this is something that few athletes recently have begun to think about What are some of the motivations in your mind for going to law school Are you thinking about possibly what you would do after your career are you thinking about the fact that this enables you to use your reputation and athletics to be able to be useful to people in a variety ways Are you thinking about it in terms of business What are some of the motivation because this is the type of thing that many athletes should be thinking about

Speaker 8 00:06:44.540
Well definitely Roscoe I just feel that there are certain athletes who have the capabilities or going on to further their education and I feel that I'm in a position NFL enough feel retrospectively that sports has opened a lot of doors for me It's helped me to meet you A lot of people a lot important people in my life who've had a hell of influence on me as a person and I feel that you know I want to be in a position such that when when I when I get ready to finish my professional career as an athlete I can finish without worrying about where is my next dollar coming from Being in a very precarious situation whereby I don't know what I'm gonna do in life I think a man is supposed to be someone who knows his goals and knows his objectives and has a means of reaching those goals and objectives

Speaker 1 00:07:32.390
I just think that I can better run the service to my community and service to the world and try to make this a better place by pursuing a law degree and helping people in various fields the legalities is very interesting you highlighted the dilemma of the athlete and won him the land or the athlete is idolized by people wanting your autograph telling you how great you are your name's on the back of the newspaper or the front of the newspaper on the other hand you have a very limited time perspective in terms of when you're really functioning five years 10 years maybe 15 years and then you still retired or not playing at the age of 30 to 34 36 38 and an entire life in front of you and what you are saying that you do in moments you feel you need to get your head together and your your life together your skills together while you're still playing so that when you cease playing you'll be able to be of service not only to yourself but to your community

Speaker 6 00:08:31.250
You know it definitely you at the point in the head I think for too long the athlete especially a black athlete has been stereotype as being so you can only run up and down the court to throw a baseball throw a football But like I said I think the time's come to pass I think athlete I think it's a tragic thing that athletes almost dissect it in the sense and fragment and sense that people have a tendency not to realize their complete total individuals and their political views they have social views They have a philosophical points they have philosophical points in life and life is very difficult in the sports or in society as we had whereby people and especially young people put you on a pedestal and placed in your place in your net pedestal I think they create a problem and that problem is lack communications between that person on a pedestal and the person below And I think once they put you on a pedestal that they speak for you to respond and react in a certain way and when you react differently The other call you a very arrogant militant athlete a very political athlete No I think I want to be called a little political class athlete I think I want to be aware of what's happened from day to day anywhere outside of basketball because like you just said a mutiny in the game is a very limited one and like in that sense like you can't go for 20 30 years being an athlete And I think for some people at professional athletics is very degrading in the sense that you're just a commodity and like it gets to the point where sometime in life you can get fed up with that and maybe you want to do something else

Speaker 4 00:10:10.600
Speaking of athletics and the larger society you are very active with the Sports Foundation which is a group it was organized by Bob Williams who was a former basketball captain at New York University some years ago to use sports as a means of guidance and counseling and opening up new avenues of social responsibility with young people What are some of the things that you've done in your capacity as a member of the advisory committee of the Sports Foundation to help it move along

Speaker 6 00:10:40.240
Well my philosophy is affected I contend that many state city agencies and municipalities have been remiss in their duties and responsibilities to the community and the development of their young people And I think as a result of that Subsequently a lot of the weight has fallen a lot of community programs such as Sports Foundation Harlem professional league etc. And in that sense a lot of the weight is for fallen on the on the athlete I think in that sense he's responsible to the young people because they've put in put him in a position of influence I just feel that a you know I can't speak for any other athletes myself I think I know you know young people if they're involved in structured programs They keep themselves busy involved in education I just feel it's necessary that you educate yourself totally That doesn't mean necessary in academic education but it means academic in conjunction with social political and physical education I think if you stifle development of your body Thank you Consequently your man is not alert has learned as should be And I feel that athletes role in today has changed somewhat I don't think he no longer just be a gladiator Somebody is entertaining people I think he has to be involved in the totality of his being in the sense that he has to be involved in every facet of life especially in his community especially where he is is hugely respected the most Most black athletes do come from the ghetto overnight and that sense they have to make a contribution you know and I realize it you know I'm young and I'm I'm a bachelor and I'm single So like a lot of responsibilities maybe a married man had a somewhat somebody who's involved in a lot of businesses maybe it might not have as much time as that now allow for that because I realized that in the game for maybe 10 years at the most and you get to maximize on what you can make in life just from the financial perspective But in the same breath I think you do have an obligation to young people

Speaker 3 00:12:49.470
Well speaking of that obligation in terms of the Sports Foundation I know that you spend literally hundreds of hours working with small groups of young people tutoring them in basketball techniques But beyond that Yes going to the various functions of the Sports Foundation the Harlem Junior Olympics the track meet the karate exhibitions the boxing matches the softball games and the girls basketball games Working with some of the officials the young men who go and young women who officiate these games to help them both in organizing developing organizational skills but also giving some of your basketball knowledge and also some of your social and counseling philosophy I gather just from observing you that you enjoy very much working with young people you like to talk whether you like to talk with them face to face rather than talk with them in terms of a crowd

Speaker 6 00:13:48.240
Definitely crowds I believe in the personal person person and person in conversation dialogue I just feel that young people very exciting fascinating and I just want to get involved and do as much as I can You know I think the least I can do is make appearances and counsel young people and give them advice in certain areas especially involving the decision to go to school

Speaker 9 00:14:12.550
What you should take in school what you should know What do you see as a vocation

Speaker 1 00:14:16.880
Well I noticed one thing that they were recruiting one of the great basketball players

Speaker 4 00:14:21.930
I think names which Lee Butch Lee and I think he ended up at Marquette your alma mater but one of the things that was pointed up in the press now you told me personally is that you didn't feel that you needed to put any extra pressure on Butch or anyone else to sell Marquette or any school right

Speaker 1 00:14:39.120
There were many schools that might meet the needs of young people and that ultimately it is the student himself the athlete himself who has to make that decision

Speaker 6 00:14:49.020
Well Roscoe you know being in the position a comfortable position for five years six seven years ago I was fair was fly by going back seven years ago you know I realized the various pressures that he encountered in being mean

Speaker 8 00:15:03.360
We now know high school athletes you know it's probably gotten coaches to take him out Duncan taking this school taking this place and I knew when I was going through those changes I got fed up with it and that gets the point where I just want to make a decision And I didn't want to be an additional pressure on Butch because I felt that he had enough to contend with at the moment and I felt that by me putting my my two cents in I thought I had nothing to contribute and I feel that I'm interested in but really not that I'm not interested in Marquette University Marquette is going to survive the butler goes to school or not And I feel that puts Lee has to go to an institution where he can maximize his physical abilities and basketballs because he's since he's a blue chip high school ball player is power capable He has a lot of built his and if he goes to the right school whereby he can use his abilities I think he can play professional sports And I think in this sense I'm interested in Butch Lee as a person because he's black

Speaker 10 00:16:00.480
And I realized that sports is one of the main avenues that are open to black people because the other point and one that I personally make quite often and that is that any college that takes an athlete has an obligation to see that he gets an education which means that the selection of a college by an athlete has to be related to the extent to which he receives that college is serious about seeing that he gets the type of counseling tutoring courses that will cause him to end up with a degree because ultimately despite all of the professional contracts or what have you The main thing that an athlete should get out of going to college is an education symbolized by a degree

Speaker 8 00:16:42.760
I couldn't agree with you more Roscoe I think an education is top priority in today's society I feel that if you go to school full year get a certificate of attendance you go to school for years and maybe explore exploit it by that institution because you know you use and in return you should use that institution to get an education to develop yourself as a person totally And I think in that sense that I can say a Marquette University analyzed to a hell of a job especially black athletes for the metropolitan area I can't think of one who's gone who has gone four years who hasn't graduate and he's got a thing whereby if you don't graduate like a full year school senior let me ask the question

Speaker 3 00:17:26.740
Tonight we're talking with the dean messenger New York basketball star who is now with the Atlanta Hawks and is very active in a variety of activities in the New York metropolitan area We're talking about the role of sports in the lives of black youth and very specifically what you were saying about the young men who stay in college for four years and graduate There's something new that has developed known as the so-called hardship situation hardship case whereby some type of certification

Speaker 1 00:17:56.980
College athletes are identified as having financial hardship and then are drafted away or from their college after they've played one or two or three years I can understand the the financial pressures and particularly the pressures of the leagues to get these players in when they're very good Dr. J Jewish being one of them But I also have some real misgivings about the extent of which the professional leagues really should put themselves into a position to seduce young men away from their education before they complete it What are some of your views on this They don't necessarily have to be consonant with mine or with the basketball establishment Therefore I'd be interested in what you have to say about that

Speaker 8 00:18:42.610
Well you know the hardship case I think there are advantages and disadvantages to the hardship case And I think that depends on the individual situation I feel that there are a lot of people in the world financial difficulty and they need money and a lot of black athletes who more or less the father their founders even though they are going to school pursuing an education that they have financial responsibility because maybe their fathers of the Father's Day and Mother's Day and they help help helping wanted the parents support the family in that particular case I think it's necessary You have a moral obligation if it comes of that you can't get some money Now in another sense I spoke with several people that I think made a bad decision not to go hardship if you go hardship said in the USA my junior year there's only so much money you can demand you know and I feel that if you just go and additionally and get your net good get an education you'll be that much more value because PR is 50 percent of your contract anyway and like you can only receive so much PR through your freshman your sophomore year because the PR is delegated to most of the juniors and seniors in upperclassmen But I feel let's in it since it hurts a lot of guys Plus physically speaking I don't think a lot of people at 19 and 20 are just ready for professional sports mentally or physically I think it terminates a lot of people's careers early

Speaker 3 00:20:13.050
That's a very strong point and an additional point is that it tends to suggest that colleges are minor leagues for professional teams which in fact is probably the case but it tends to make it so much more dramatic that you talk with some high school basketball players You don't ask them when you ask them what are they going to do by going to college Say I'm going to play basketball It's not I'm going to take pre law I'm going to become an accountant or whatever I'm going to play basketball

Speaker 1 00:20:43.220
And whereas basketball or football might be a means is certainly should not be an n And I think this hardship case tends to make it very very clear that for many young people and for many colleges the professional route is in fact the end definitely of it since you have a sports or in society they reinforced this all the time

Speaker 8 00:21:05.780
I made a statement paper you know several months ago to the fact that I think I was a professional athlete when I was in grammar school I got recruited at a grammar school at age 12 13

Speaker 7 00:21:19.320
I think that cycle psychologically professional and in some ways thanks a lot

Speaker 8 00:21:24.580
I think it's difficult for a youngster that 10 A's to deal with that problem of recruitment And I think from the time I was in eighth grade I've been recruited all my life And in that sense I think I've been a professional athlete because they paid me to the extent that they sent me to school and books and coffee or whatever And you know like I think in that sense you're being paid like you say I think colleges and universities just file systems for the professionals you know and this just it is tragic in the sense it has to be that way because I think sports and I'm sure love is a very beautiful thing

Speaker 4 00:22:02.250
You are a very fortunate young man you must have had some strong family influences and some great teachers to be able to put this in perspective because you're quite right Literally thousands of youth many of them black youth many of them black youth from the ghetto who are hounded and recruited for whatever their physical skills are I also know that you are a good teacher I saw you working and coaching the parochial all stars in the Sports Foundation a high school classic the public golf guys versus a parochial and private all stars and everyone commented on what a fine teacher you are And I note that you are going to do some teaching this summer You are planning a series of basketball camps which you call the dean manage your basketball schools Could you tell us something about that what a is your objective in getting into this other than the business aspect of it but knowing you that you have objectives beyond that

Speaker 1 00:23:01.200
I know that in addition to the camps that you're running in the more affluent neighborhoods which require money people pay for You also are running some camps in the Harlem community which will be either low cost or no cost So could you tell us something about your objectives in this area

Speaker 8 00:23:21.690
Well basically Russ good idea originated through Bob Wayne's byways as President Director Sports Foundation Bob you know spent several years in Spain playing that summer professional basketball He returned to New York I guess 66 67 And now as president we work with several programs in inner city programs for the Urban League And I wasn't necessarily happy with what was happening the results of those programs So I met Bob Barr ways and subsequently I was impressed by Bob as a man as an individual has somebody been responsive to the sensitivities that young people And I felt this is there it is I want to pursue because I was in a position to assess that I influenced a lot of people I felt that to structure a program comparable to the supposed foundation I suppose foundation I can work and meet a lot of kids So like you know as a kid I never went to camp I know what a basketball can The first basketball camp I went to ours an instructor And like I felt I feel that a lot of kids miss a lot by not going away to camp because financially speaking their parents just can't afford to send in the camp paint and 52 and it does

Speaker 5 00:24:40.530
So Bob myself you see this idea of an inner city basketball camp Several years ago and we just put implement in this philosophy now and we felt we felt that it kids who can't pay and fifty dollars hence any fouls So like what we did this year at a minimum cost Sandy fired us We are introducing a new concept the basket inner city basketball where kids commute every day Its location is going to be a very high school in Brooklyn New York You know was left up to me I wouldn't have the kids pay it off But you know this is a business venture I think it comes of more more for the young people than for people involved from a business perspective And of course at this camp you have some of your former teammates that news banner with the Knicks you know like with these young people and also day to day care risk I to be August 26 dog's 30th and some of the stars they'll be there be Earl Monroe Nate Archibald Henry baby

Speaker 7 00:25:39.780
Now Dave is hot on some of the parts We would go to definitely I hope so

Speaker 1 00:25:45.510
If anyone is interested how do they get in touch with you or the sponsors of the camp or what have you Because I know it's important when you're dealing with something like this to be able to get people to come Because if you don't get people to come the concept doesn't develop

Speaker 8 00:26:01.200
And again in conjunction with this particular camp that has been is running in Brooklyn by way into myself we're going to sponsor a bet and then city basketball camp at 130 named the neighborhood that I grew up in as a park on June 30 9th in Lenox And I think this will be free camp for people in the community I think this is the least I can do for them And I think a lot of young people look up to me they respect me

Speaker 3 00:26:25.110
What What dates will those be sometime during the month of August also

Speaker 5 00:26:28.950
Definitely sometimes Probably doing the home Junior Olympics which is in the third week of the week in August

Speaker 1 00:26:35.940
By the way do you have contact

Speaker 8 00:26:37.650
Well you know if you wanna contact me for any further information Right DMM job city basketball camp Box 1 84 Staten Island New York

Speaker 3 00:26:48.630
Box 184 Staten Island New York Any in memory

Speaker 8 00:26:51.700
And if you like the city basketball camp is area code 2 1 2 the numbers 6 9 8 0 7 5 3 area code 2 1 2 6 9 8 0 7 5 3 0 7 5 3

Speaker 1 00:27:05.520
All right so folks who entered into the member basketball camp and call a record 2 1 2 6 9 8 0 7 5 3 Yeah Devon Now as far as the program in Harlem that will be coordinated out of the sports foundation park I believe during union Olympic week they're gonna call it sports foundation Plaza at one hundred thirty ninth and Lenox Avenue

Speaker 5 00:27:28.710
I think that's a good name because the park I think Bob has done so much for the community and I think in kind of Park Sports Foundation is a reflection of what he has done in the community And Mrs. Green who is in charge of the park has done a wonderful job too and a new dean manager you have done a wonderful job

Speaker 1 00:27:48.300
