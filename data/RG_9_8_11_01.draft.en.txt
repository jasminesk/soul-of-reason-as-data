Speaker 1 00:00:01.900
In the summer of 1974 the Gateway National Recreation Area began operation This was one of the first urban park sponsored by the federal government here Diane Harris William Cohen Blum and Francis Jefferson discuss public involvement in the planning for the Gateway National Recreation Area On tonight's soul of reason This is Soul of reason a program that will examine the roots of the black box

Speaker 2 00:00:48.750
Soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University

Speaker 3 00:01:09.270
Our guests on tonight soul of reason are from the Gateway National Recreation Area which is a federal park conducted by the Department of Interior With us Diane Harris whose public involvement assistant Frances Gibson who is recreation specialist and William Cohen Blum who is on the planning board for the National Recreation Area Possibly Frances we could begin by having you tell our audience exactly what the Gateway National Recreation Area is It spread all over New York and it's a little difficult to pin it down I think it would be important for the audience to know this

Speaker 4 00:01:44.640
Roscoe we have 26000 acres a national park lands that consist of former military city and state parks The headquarters for this Gateway National Recreation Area is at Floyd Bennett feel in Brooklyn We have the Jamaica Bay unit Breezy Point unit and Staten Island unit in New York and then in Sandy Hook's New Jersey We have Fort Hancock over there which was a surplus military lands We have Fort Wadsworth at Staten Island We have Fort Tilden and Breezy Point and along with Floyd Bennett Field so and I'm big problem here of course is to try to develop this part in conjunction with the input from citizens in and around the area

Speaker 3 00:02:32.630
And did you mention Reese park because I know many of the citizens of New York will remember Reese Park which I guess many citizens still think is a city park

Speaker 4 00:02:40.950
But I understand is part of the Gateway National Recreation Area Reese Park it is definitely part of the Gateway National Recreation Area in this part of the Breezy Point unit

Speaker 5 00:02:49.020
And of course that's in the area adjacent to Fort Tilden now Bill the idea of developing a national park in an urban area is somewhat new as many people in the audience know the great national parks of this country are out in the wilderness Now why did the federal government respond to the demands of urban people for more involvement of the federal government in recreation by setting up this gateway National Recreation Area

Speaker 6 00:03:21.270
Well Roscoe the idea goes back to the late latter days of the Johnson administration under secretary of interior Udall and then under secretary of interior Hickel in the next early Nixon administration the idea was to bring parks to the people where the people are It's very clear that many many people in our major cities can't reach the big parks of the West and the Southwest and the creation of Gateway National Recreation Area right in the city and on adjacent beaches was an attempt to really bring federal parks to people in the major concentrations of our population

Speaker 5 00:03:56.220
And of course in Jamaica Bay Area tremendous amount of open land some of it swamp land But it's land where there's a lot of nature I know you have some birdwatching there there's some excellent undersea life there that you can be looked at so that in a sense it is sort of natural that there be a national park in New York in New York City in a metropolitan area Now you said prior to the show this was only one of two or three national parks in urban areas Could you tell us where the others are

Speaker 6 00:04:29.540
Well the original urban national park is in Washington D.C. what's called the National Capital parks the National Park Service and Department of Interior run all the monuments and green spaces within the city of Washington and that's considered national capital parks The other major urban national park is in the city of San Francisco and the sermon Cisco bay area that's called Golden Gate National Recreation Area That's our sister Park is sister to our Gateway National Recreation Area here in New York and New Jersey

Speaker 3 00:05:03.920
And I say so in the sense this park is an experiment and part of the success of the experiment will be the extent to which we get citizens involved in both planning the park and using the pot So Diane I'd like to ask you what has been done to date to help deal with the public's involvement in the park and of course in New York City we have and the metropolitan area have people from all ethnic backgrounds religious groups economic levels racial groups etc. and that does really involve a tremendous amount of planning So what's been done to date

Speaker 7 00:05:41.050
Okay What we have is a public involvement team which consist of right now six members and we've been collecting various Mayor mailing list and we've been informing people through letters about Gateway and insisting that we come to see them and talk to them a little about Gateway One of our constraint is that the mailing lists are not up to date

Speaker 8 00:06:09.150
Okay Now that's very interesting As a typical public relations page you turn immediately to mailing lists out explains the mailing list I'd update But there are literally millions of people walking the streets of New York City and New Jersey and so on What else are you doing I'm not trying to overly criticize you but I want to focus on the fact that we do have to reach out and get those people exactly

Speaker 7 00:06:32.280
OK We've been giving out to people receiving references from people who are really interested in Gateway and they've also been referring us to other people that we can talk to to inform them about Gateway and the various workshops that will be coming into view in October We've developed a newsletter which is called Gateway outlook which will become a second edition of the newsletter we'll be coming out in October And we hope to be sending that out to all people that we've been in contact with and hopefully the people that come to the workshops as well

Speaker 3 00:07:07.960
Now one of the things I found very interesting is that a lot of people don't really know what Gateway is and consistent with the role of sole reason we try to interpret to the black in the minority community some of the things that are happening in terms of our life space Now why is it that a lot of people still don't know that Reese Park is a part of a national park and they still think it's a city park Now I think that's a minor issue in one sense but it's a major issue in terms of getting the scope of this gateway park over to people particularly people from minority communities because a number of people from minority communities use park What about that day and why or why is it that we haven't gotten that across and what are you doing to try to get that across

Speaker 7 00:07:50.260
Well all I can say at this point is that we're doing everything possible to form minority people as well as the overall urban area about Reese park and who it belongs to As of now we've been through our talks through meetings with people we've been trying to express the fact that Jacob Reese piece beach excuse me is no longer a part of the city but is now taken over by the federal government

Speaker 3 00:08:19.540
And hopefully they can spread the word to others about the park one way of doing that of course is to show that there is an improvement in service and in France and I'd like to ask you to what extent has there been an improvement in service to the people of this metropolitan area Now that one of our great park resources Reese Park great kills Park are now taken over by the federal government because as a taxpayer as a citizen I would like to say well this means improvement of service and expansion of program Now what is being done along those lines well Roscoe you're right

Speaker 9 00:08:55.330
It doesn't mean the fact that the National Park Service was taken over these this park means that the services have improved No the parks are clean We have our park police for security We have the type of services there that will enable the citizens to come and use the park and be safe you know be secure and they have clean wholesome facilities in the parks now And many of these things just didn't happen before And we've had a long time working in cleaning up the park to make it to bring it up to the type of standards that a National Park Service insist upon And of course it takes manpower and it takes time But the other thing is that we also have certain responsibilities for public input as we develop the park So what we have been doing for the last two years just sort of maintaining the park in the manner in which the people can use it and can be exposed to the park Wow The planning team develops our immediate intermediate and long range plans for these parks

Speaker 5 00:10:02.270
Now Bill you're on Bill Cohen looming with the City University I believe your field sociology You're on the planning team and of course planning involves people and it involves program It's nice to have a park it's physically clean and you can get to and so on What are some of the things that you're considering in your planning

Speaker 10 00:10:20.890
I think the key that's really the key question Roscoe a lot of people think of planning and development in terms of building and pouring of concrete and creating new structures but in this day and age I think we need to think more and more in terms of organization and bringing people's talents and energies to focus on particular places and titular kinds of activities and this is the ideal This this new national park in New York City is an ideal place just for that kind of thing I would say that our biggest problem is reaching out as you were pointing to before reaching out to people with talent and with ability from all the communities of the city particularly from the minority communities of the city to get their culture and their ways of expression in their talents in our national park At Floyd Bennett Field at Reese Park and the other places where we have opportunities to put on programs as an indication of the kind of thing that is being done I know Francis won't talk about this himself because he doesn't like to blow his own horn but we had some emergency legislation passed last summer to create new jobs for people in New York City because of the high unemployment Francis capitalized on that emergency legislation which created funds for a youth conservation corps program and in one week's time Francis Gibson organized a camp at Gateway National Recreation Area where he had counselors and environmental education program and young people hired on a weekly wage who were also in an educational program and all of this was accomplished in the space of one one week It was an emergency program which Francis Gibson and the other people who worked with him put together This is the kind of thing I'm talking about We need more and more to be able to capitalize on existing resources human and social that we have at our disposal and frequently just don't have the time or the knowledge to be able to marshal you know now Diane as the public involvement assistant you were involved in a campaign that's gonna hit the citizens of the metropolitan area immediately

Speaker 11 00:12:31.540
Mike in the next two or three weeks could you tell us about this particular plan I think you call it your workshop program Would you tell us what the workshops are what they intended to accomplish and how people might become involved in

Speaker 12 00:12:45.840
Okay The workshops will be scheduled for October They will give people an opportunity to express what they would like to see in the park So what if they have any grievances about the park It will give them a chance to express these grievances and tell us what they would like to see whereas we would bring them back to the plan is and they would you know formulate some type of scenario so that we can bring them back out to the public It is important that people come to these workshops because it's their park okay It's very important that they come out to the workshops and develop a rapport with the people who are trying to help develop their park Those workshops are scheduled for as follows October 1st at 730 pm Floyd Bennett Field building 270 to Flatbush Avenue Brooklyn New York October 4th one o'clock PM Sandy Hook Chapel Fort Hancock Sandy Hook New Jersey

Speaker 11 00:13:55.820
Now I believe there will also be workshops on the 8th 9th 11th and 14th with the one at the 14th me in New York at the City University Center Anyone who is interested in getting information about these workshops should call 2 5 2 8 1 0 1 Our guest on tonight soul of reason have been Diane Harris when Colin bloom and Francis Gibson of the Gateway National Recreation Area

Speaker 1 00:14:26.560
This evening we are talking about the Gateway National Recreation Area and ways of improving citizen participation

Speaker 11 00:14:35.320
We're talking with Diane Harris Francis Gibson and William Quindlen Now as we talk about citizen participation if you were to ask me as a citizen to come to a meeting like a workshop I'd say What am I going to say What are you going to do about what I'm concerned about For example you have a big area in Jamaica Jamaica Bay I'm an inner city resident I can't reach it I don't know anything about birdwatching etc. What do you expect from me What do you want to do for me now Francis someone asked you the question what are some of the innovative programs that you have in mind for the park Because I know you have some ideas of this type right

Speaker 13 00:15:18.300
Waskow one of the things that we should explain here is we have two teams we have this planning team and they are concerned about intermediate and long range plans but we also have to operate the park on a day to day basis And I'm part of this operational team and some of the things that we do of course is we For example we have a youth program and Bill Cornwell mentioned the ICC program It was an abbreviated program that we ran this past summer But as a result of being involved in the ICC program now there a possibility of us having a job course in or here we have a lot of land a lot of buildings out there and it's our business to come up with programs that will utilize these facilities So as soon as we wrap up the ICC reports then our next project will be as project manager for the job corps

Speaker 3 00:16:13.040
Now tell us what the wise people did I think Bill described dramatically how you put these people together but what did they do once they got there

Speaker 13 00:16:21.190
All right then I should say that the why C.C. is of course environmental education activity and these young people working on projects they had 40 hour week and 30 hours will work projects and 10 hours had to have an environmental education lesson involved with it and there are projects for the most part were developed in conjunction with how they related to the environment These students were recruited to these schools and they had an interest in the environment so they came into our program at Floyd Bennett Field and we had various work projects had to do with the nature study trails had to do with the Marine Life around the gateway and the environment education teacher and went right along with them and in fact doing the project she could stop a work project and explain how these various things fit into the environment We really had only 31 young people involved Roscoe 15 boys and 15 girls and they were a cross-section of the community but we only had room for 30 but doing the town we had 31 people which means one young man had to take another job because of transportation But we had 25 of these young people had a perfect attendance doing a four week period so you can understand how interested they were And of course the need is there So we expect to continue to WTC program next year Maybe we'll have two games maybe one at Sandy Hook New Jersey We certainly would have an enlarge came but Floyd Bennett Field and hopefully we can continue to work with the young people in this area to out some outlets for them provide a recreation programs of course which is my basic thing here but also to expose them to the Gateway National Recreation Area and his programs and the environments here and begin to build the clientele tell all citizens for using the parks now Bill and as we look at that large facility Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn Flatbush Avenue

Speaker 5 00:18:29.800
What are some of the things that can be done with it now Reno the government is known to take facilities they don't need anymore and and dump them on the public Now what's going to be done Are they going to tear down some of those buildings are they going to reconstruct them and use them for things other than office space because a tremendous amount of area out there and I hear sometimes they have model airplane races and so on but that's almost like what it was constructed for fly airplanes But there must be some other things that might be considered there as a member the planning team I'm sure you must have some ideas along those lines

Speaker 10 00:19:05.380
We're considering quite a range of possibilities The number of requests that we have from the public is already staggering Here are some of the proposals that have been suggested to the planning team and that are being seriously considered There are six miles of runways on that old airfield and some portion of that can be used as a drag strip for four people who are into that kind of activity in Brooklyn and Queens and elsewhere around the city Another portion of those runways could be developed into tennis courts because the surfaces are right there already We have we have approximately 100 buildings on Floyd field about 30 of them are large hangars Well not quite 30 maybe 10 large hangars which would accommodate the various kinds of year round recreation We have a hockey proposal to make one of them into a hockey rink with outdoor and indoor ice for figure skating and organized hockey leagues And there's also quite a heavy demand for roller hockey which is a growing sport in the city There's quite a bit of sentiment that we should have accommodations for small boat owners not large boats yachts but rowboats and small fishing boats so that a person living in an apartment house in Bedford Stuyvesant or even in Manhattan could leave the boat out in one of these huge hangars that we have at Floyd Bennett Field and come out on a day off for a weekend and have that boat put in the water out there and go fishing in Jamaica Bay the fishing in Jamaica Bay is superb as you probably know one of the things I know you've talked about is the transportation problem because if the parks are really going to serve the entire metropolitan area it means more than serving the residents who live a mile or so away

Speaker 5 00:20:52.260
And given the fact that all of these parks or segments of your park on the water sides of the islands of New York in New Jersey what are you gonna do about transportation is there going to be cheaper transportation

Speaker 10 00:21:06.680
Are you going to have buses that are established mainly to take people they have expressed trained one of the some of the things you're going to do about that now Bill compliment question transportation is a very difficult issue Roscoe partly because the National Park Service is not a transportation agency changes in the transportation service to the park are going to have to be the result of a lot of public sentiment and pressure on Congress The congressional delegations here to get funds for us to improve the transportation we need to cooperate with the city and the state and the other agencies

Speaker 14 00:21:39.840
But there's a lot that can be done to great candidates

Speaker 8 00:21:42.490
Politics very very usual had bureaucrats I mean a little facetious but that is the tendency Well it's not our bailiwick it's somebody else's now being realistic about it

Speaker 14 00:21:58.020
There is no federal transportation service here How do you expect to get minority people people who live in the heart of beds die and the Bronx et cetera to this park It is possible to work for laboratory play with the transportation agency to have special buses that go there It is possible to negotiate reduced fares and I believe having heard you talk before you are thinking about some of those things This is why I think a little bit to it but I also want to point up to citizens and our listeners that there are some other possibilities

Speaker 10 00:22:31.670
You're right Roscoe I mean there has to be cheaper transportation The key to the success of this park will be that we have to have better bus service from the Flatbush Avenue subway we've got to have better bus service on Staten Island we have to have express bus service from the communities closer to Manhattan We've got to have ferry service and we've got to have a ferry service which is subsidized to some extent because it becomes prohibitively expensive And all these things are possible but they're all I was trying to say was that they're not the park is the tail of the dog And we've got to try to develop a demand We've got to try to develop a park which has got attractive programs And once we start doing that people are going to start demanding that they be able to get there

Speaker 11 00:23:19.980
All right now Diane that brings us to the public involvement Now you're gonna have these workshops which begin on October 1st and goes to the 14th and you're hoping that citizens will come They're going to be workshops at each one of the park sites in Great Kills Sandy Hook and Breezy Point etc. Now what's going to be done at those workshops So what can you tell our audience that's going to happen that's gonna be exciting that will make them want to come other than just basically their citizen duty

Speaker 12 00:23:50.520
Okay It's gonna give them a chance to express their ideas and to hopefully see some of their ideas come into being in the near future Hopefully it'll give them a chance to express grievances if they have any with the park It will also give them a chance to see some of the people be introduced to some of the people who are you know in charge of the park and who are willing to help them develop this park

Speaker 11 00:24:17.880
I see now the sessions will at various times summit one and someone 730 and as we suggested earlier those interested in attending these sessions should contact the Gateway National Recreation Area at 2 5 2 8 1 0 1 I believe the one on October 1st is at Floyd Bennett Field October 4th at Sandy Hook October 8 That Great Kills Park October 9th in Newark at the Howard Johnson motor large October 11th at Breezy Point at Fort Tilden Chapel building and the basic New York City meeting is at the City University Graduate Center which is located on Forty second Street and that will be at 730 pm on October 14th Now when those folks come to those meetings are they going to be assigned to specific topic areas or are they going to work as a group to try to work out their grievances or are they going to hear speeches of what what's going to how they're not going to be assigned to any particular group or any particular topic

Speaker 12 00:25:26.530
It's their workshop okay they're going to be the ones who decide what types of things they want done There's not going to be any said format exactly who's going to be the ringleader of the you know of the workshops Everyone's gonna have their chair their fair chairs to express their needs and what they like to see in the parks OK There's not going to be a leader or someone who's going to dominate who's going to be the true professional type person Everyone's gonna be there to do their own thing so to speak

Speaker 3 00:26:01.660
Now is they're going to be a follow up to the workshop Because obviously when people present grievances and program ideas someone on staff has to take them and synthesize them and decide what to do about them What kind of follow up

Speaker 12 00:26:13.740
Exactly There will definitely be a file follow up and hopefully the way I see it is that we'll write down just about all the things that people have said and expressed get letters out to these people to make sure that everything that they've said is on this on this list If not they can write reply to us and tell us well you didn't put this down or this isn't exactly what we said

Speaker 11 00:26:40.510
This is how it's supposed to be read after we receive that back hopefully we can comply and I try and understand what people are saying to us and I believe you plan to develop a tentative master plan for operation of the park which will be presented in three or four months to the rest of the community to evaluate our guest on tonight So reason have been Diane Harris Francis Gibson and William Conn Blum of the Gateway National Recreation Area and they have been talking about ways of involving the public in the planning of this national park here in New York City

Speaker 15 00:27:15.970
