Speaker 1 00:00:01.320
It is generally acknowledge that black writing is the most creative development and recent literary history here Professor Addison gale of Baruch College discussed the exciting world of black literature onto Knight's soul of reason This is the sole reason a program will examine the roots of the black

Speaker 2 00:00:40.400
Soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute about American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time Here now is your hosts Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of American affairs at New York University is with us this evening on solar reason is Professor Allison Gale who is associate professor of English at Baruch College of the City University of New York

Speaker 1 00:01:09.810
He's a well-known writer a well-known critic and we're going to be talking about the status of black writing today Glad to have you with us on the program tonight Thank you Roscoe Great to be here Now let's talk about black writing We said at the top of the show that it is the most creative development in recent literary history and I think the reason why people feel that is that it's sort of just being discovered there's always been great black writing but more recently in the 60s and 70s it's really just being discovered So what are some of the things that are happening in black writing today that tend to bring about this excitement

Speaker 3 00:01:44.370
Well I would think for one thing that black writing has moved away from the old traditions and the sense that black writers have by and large it is very confusing so that you can't really make it in a you can't draw a clear cut diagram for the most part black writers are not writing the traditional protest novel

Speaker 4 00:02:09.960.0000000000146
Secondly black writers are less attentive these days than they used to be to all of the traditional academic concepts which in the sense defined out black letter which i.e. universality etc. And I would suppose Third the black writers have begun to realize that by exploring the black experience in total One comes up with a literature that deals in terms Of black people much more so than say literature Jesse Fowler said William Stanley Braithwaite of course the role of literature the arts in general is to communicate

Speaker 5 00:02:52.680
To one's fellow man the feelings and the passions and the concerns and their hopes and aspirations of the particular cultures that the writer comes from It's very difficult to write about something you write insightfully about something you don't know anything about of course is write a newspaper article then you report it But if you are a writer or a poet a short story writer an essay as you're writing about something that you live and feel and breathe and in a sense it's quite natural for black writers to try to mimic the Victorian or the Elizabethan stylist yeah when they had their own culture their own experience to write about

Speaker 3 00:03:31.240
Well I see the problem with that is is really an academic one and that is that if one talks about the literary establishment the rules and canons have battled for a very long time prescribed by the academic community after all books are really bought read in the universities Now what the academic establishment has often said in terms of black writing is that there is no black culture no no particular black experience that one can differentiate from that of the overall American experience Therefore the black writer must then direct his his his explication as explorations to what is supposedly a common American experience Now what this negated was that the quote melting pot end quote had never melted and that there are distinct black experiences even though they do as Ellison has said merge at some point with the overall larger American experience

Speaker 5 00:04:33.270
I think you see this in terms of Jewish writing historically Jewish writers have basically many of the themes that the great Jewish writers people like bellow have Saul Bellow have written about themes that yes kind of cross everyone rhetorically but they have a particular identity that roots itself in the Jewish culture and has been a contributory to the stream of American culture but at the same time is different and probably if we look back to the Harlem Renaissance in the Renaissance many of our writers are really trying to mimic some of the writing that was considered to be good style and stylized writing Yet we had people like Claude McKay who were trying to break out of that and describe the black experience And of course we have the legendary Langston Hughes who in his own way is only a cinematic way developed a style which was its Langston Hughes style but also it's really a reflection of what happens in those black beauty shops and black barber shops on the corner which is just as important as what happened on Hester Street in the Jewish ghetto or what might happen on Mulberry Street in the Italian ghetto or what happened in Beacon Hill in Boston

Speaker 4 00:05:50.280
It was certainly sorry to hear you say I've always argued that one cannot divorce Black Literature from the sociology politics and history of this country And if you look at what has been going on traditionally in black literature it has been a reflection of the larger society suggesting that there is nothing valuable in the black experience right now Too many black writers accept that that is dictum and therefore attempted to write material that did not reflect the black experience You're quite right about Langston and McKay and Rudolf fish because it is in the Harlem Renaissance that you got this tremendous chasm between what I call the old guard and the new writers and that is Braithwaite and Jesse foul said On the one hand arguing of course that the black writer must continue to impress the American society with the fact that he is almost an assimilated Bill item and people like Hughes on the other hand are arguing that look we have a distinct culture that we have a tradition and we must pay attention to that That that is the job of the writer This comes together in the Harlem Renaissance a very tremendous way

Speaker 5 00:07:04.710
And of course the Harlem Renaissance many people in a way it was really subsidized largely by the white community or settlers the so-called patrons of the arts the van victims and the wealthy people who came to Harlem to more or less be voyeurs Sure looking in on this esoteric culture sure And when the crash came and 29 and 30 the White money that was supporting the Renaissance went down the drain and therefore the the energy black writing had to really depend on the quality of black writing and the extent of which blacks and those whites who were really interested in the black community would buy and relate to black writing and of course that's where magazines like the crisis and opportunity which became a major publication vehicle for black writing and a major role

Speaker 6 00:07:56.340
But it also may relate to the next question I want to ask you and that is the role of the novel It appears that weakest development in black writing has been the novel

Speaker 5 00:08:07.410
We've had lots of in terms of quantity not necessarily how they began Richard They have some of course a great novel and several others But we had a tremendous amount of quality quantity in poetry in essays and short stories And now you've more recently in place you can shut plays but the novel which may well be the most difficult thing you construct in the literary world is something that the there really has not been a great breakthrough on What's your opinion about that I know you went on about that and I know you've thought about

Speaker 7 00:08:43.830.0000000000582
What's your opinion on that

Speaker 3 00:08:44.910
I would think that the novel had to go through a different kind of history in terms of a cultural breakthrough once right

Speaker 4 00:08:56.790
Had written native son of the protest novel had begun and ended Okay And I mean begun in the sense that protest novels before Richard Wright are or simply more or less monogrammed All right Native son was the protest novel but after you had written native son and after the read reverberations that right expected from native son did not occur

Speaker 8 00:09:23.700
The question then became Where is the novel going to go now Baldwin pointed it out Baldwin said in his critique of native son that there is a black tradition and that is where the novelist must go The difficulty there was that you know to write a novel it requires a great deal of expertise and not only talking about tactical The novelist has to know a great deal

Speaker 9 00:09:47.870
You have to have experience You have experience that she or he has to know literature right

Speaker 7 00:09:53.220
All right You know one of the things that bothers me if I might interject this about many black students and I suppose other students particularly black students is that somehow we believe that one can write a novel without a literary background

Speaker 3 00:10:10.710
And you know the literary black background includes writers per say I write read everything all right BALDWIN read Alice everything Alison read everything

Speaker 8 00:10:21.150
The difficulty is that our young novelists did not know enough and therefore we had a very positive view of novelists Right now I think another reason is very difficult still for a black novelist to be published in this country Very difficult I've just received the first novel by a young lady which is tremendous It's called The Del by Brenda Wilkerson I'm very surprised it was published Now I know why it was published because the House lost its major black writer quote unquote All right It's been very difficult for black novelist to be published Now I suppose another reason of course would be that there's a great deal of confusion at this point among novelists as to what the black novel should be All right and they are arguing that's a key question because that's been part of the dialogue between or about Baldwin and Allison

Speaker 5 00:11:23.010
Baraka and John Williams general killings What really should the black novel be Of course this is why the essay and the short story and the poetry which just take slices of the black experience and projects it in Mumbai do with it and it makes you laugh and cry and hate and so on had been successful But the novel which is really a painting a panoply of the whole black experience is really hard to deal with You might run down your outstanding black novels you really don't get very far on a long list You find some interesting ones that you don't get very far down that list as you run down those Sure And that really is one of the point in course You made a key point a few moment ago where you said that a publishing house lost its black writer Now of course whenever we get to a position where the quota system we should only have broken in sports so do you have more than one black player or are we broken in some aspects of entertainment but we apparently we haven't broken into the publishing I haven't got one good black writer and that's there black writer you are That's it Sure And that has to do with the controls that the publishing industry itself and those critics exercised over what is published

Speaker 4 00:12:42.180
Well of course one of the antidote to it of course is the establishment of black publishing companies What's going on on a small scale Well I think another antidote has to be that a black audience has to evolve with that and has to demand that publishing companies somehow or move outside of the all prescribed tradition It still goes on and I can go through the publishing houses and name the black writer

Speaker 5 00:13:12.510
I believe you've recently published a couple of books you want to tell our audience about that

Speaker 4 00:13:16.470
Well I've finished the way of the New World which is a history of the black novel in America and the black static of course which provided a great deal of the confusion and argumentation talked about earlier and of course the black situation that I published earlier among others

Speaker 6 00:13:37.530
And of course as a published writer and as a critic you recognize these very problems that we're talking about and one of the roles I think that people like you can play is to continue to highlight some of these concerns that affect those of us who read and appreciate black writing Well hopefully I try

Speaker 10 00:14:00.900
That's true People like yourself have a major responsibility And in this trying in this attempting to interpret etc. What is your role How do you perceive your role as a professor I know that in the revolution the emergence of black pride there has been a tendency to say well look we should only read things like you write We should not only talk about black It shouldn't be with the so-called classical creams etc. I want your opinion about that because you are an opinion maker You're a professor You're a leader and you're a key person in the black literary community

Speaker 7 00:14:35.730
Well I first usually tell students that writing like everything else involves hard work

Speaker 11 00:14:43.090
There's no excuse for it if you're not going to work for it

Speaker 12 00:14:47.150
Writing is in place for you second a writer has to know everything My argument with traditional American literature courses and English courses is that blacks have been almost totally excluded

Speaker 5 00:15:02.630
That's right No one the major major omission Sure shows of Louis Tucker American literature and you have a person read native son sir and all that relates to the black community I can't possibly have studied American literature

Speaker 12 00:15:16.470
Now I have the the other side of that of course is that one cannot then argue that some people argue that black people should only read black writers My argument is that if you're a student if you're going to be a writer you read every aspect of culture Not only American writers you read Jewish writers you read Russian writers you read African writers you read black writers all right are in addition to that

Speaker 3 00:15:50.490
And I think one has to know something about this world beyond a kind of narrow parochialism that is subject to that and most American literature courses all right

Speaker 12 00:16:01.050
And so my suggestion always to students as you read you think and you keep your eyes open you observe and you learn as much about this world as you possibly can remembering that that is what writers did

Speaker 5 00:16:17.310
One thing that you didn't mention which I know you do and I know you encourage your students to do and that is to discuss how certain that your point those of us who grew up on college campuses it's in the south and the village or what have you remember those times when we sat in the dormitory room or you sat in a bar in Greenwich Village or in Cambridge or wherever we have gone to school and argued I saw it I recall it discussing still getting your points out and then having them tested sir and with the development of the confidence that goes along with that And I think the intellectual alacrity that develops as a result of that type of thing

Speaker 13 00:16:56.850
Well certainly you know look I I have been I am often attacked for it for critical statements that I might try and people say to me now and then look why don't you answer so and so a very solemn answer because I believe that ideas are to be placed in the marketplace and they are to be debated upon discussed analyzed and taken apart because you learn that way And I think this is even truer for students It's true for all of certainly students Now a great deal of this should go on and literature courses in the college OK I'm distressed because in the college in which I teach and a great many of the literature courses the ideas usually have nothing to do with black people

Speaker 5 00:17:46.650
It does is it is inconceivable to me that one could live in 20th century America and discuss literature all right and discuss ideas without without discussing some of the ideas that blacks have contributed to the ideas of blacks who contributed and some of the central themes in our society that are related to blacks sir for example the the virulence and penetration of racism not just any black racism but anti yellow online And you read racism Sure And in terms of religion anti-Semitism anti Catholicism which have been major themes in development of you know the American ethos night to to not discuss those did not make for example let's take Faulkner for my opinions A wonderful writer had some very interesting things say about black people I didn't necessarily agree with all my sir but I probably disagreed with a goodly number of them But he had some interesting things to say about black people certainly And it's something that black people and white people need to read I need to discuss and put into some type of context Of course the way I view this is that one of the great needs and most evasions behind black studies movement was to get more of this into the circular Certainly And what we really need is Black Studies for black people I I would take a class for white black studies where I feel certain right sir

Speaker 7 00:19:13.560
For one thing black studies if it's adequately taught would help to explain a great many of the movements now occurring in the 70s Read Jimmy ball was another country And you've got three movements going on the gay liberation movement the women's movement and certainly the continuing black movement So that if one is going to understand you know it's nothing new right Said a long time ago that black people in American metaphor If you want to discuss so many ideas relating to situations going on in this country

Speaker 5 00:19:45.570
You began with black with black history and with black literature and of course probably the key reason for that is the fact that physically blacks both physically I mean in terms of the color easily identified or any context society and they get in a sense the first brush of any kind of change in terms of social climate etc. and then because of our African heritage there's a certain way of relating to the world which is somewhat different than the more controlled European or Western certainly the world And those things come into interaction in our music and you know art and dance and in our writing

Speaker 6 00:20:29.190
It's my opinion Addison that our theater black theater is much more advanced than black writing particularly our black novels our blind child development

Speaker 3 00:20:43.120
Now maybe I may want to agree with them and I really don't actually mind my argument I think with the novelists is that in certain areas they have not taken what I consider new directions I really don't want to appear here to be actually denigrating their accomplishments

Speaker 9 00:21:04.000
No not at all We do have we have made some major Yeah

Speaker 14 00:21:07.950
We have a fairly good group of novelists who are working today And though I don't agree with many I'm doing a pretty good job I have difficulty with the drama and I think I have difficulty with the drama because there has not been the kind of major debate going on among the dramatists As there has been what the novelists and with the poets so that gravitas I think the problem with that is that Baraka has stopped writing drama kind of like Baraka could have provided because of the kinds of plays that he wanted to write that he had begun to write could have provided that fulcrum across which people would disagree or agree and you might have gotten a more viable drama that I think that's an interesting point of course you really are dealing with what you might call a great man theory which I guess applies not morally Lydia You're not really I think what I'm saying is that if you're going to arrive at a point where there's a distinct direction then alternatives have to be discussed and debated and I think Baraka presented one alternative All right I think Doug Ward presents another alternative I can't get Berlin's presents another alternative but you don't have that debate going on that you have going on because that's very interesting

Speaker 5 00:22:33.620
I think your observation is correct there And that might be because of the economic success of the theater the black theater is literally has made it its made it in the sense that black audiences will see more in black theater We found that with river Niger June we found that some of it Berlin's work We found that with most recently fish we saw some of that boarded

Speaker 6 00:22:59.760
So you find that also white people will support it for some reason or another either because of the fact that the message is either more dramatic and they can associate with it not have to plow through word by word or because it might be just drawing a different clientele Well I think the support for black guys

Speaker 8 00:23:22.740
I think there's a more basic reason that as a black theater has bad and for the past four or five years and the prize that you mentioned with very few exceptions not made people uncomfortable

Speaker 7 00:23:34.170
If you read Jimmy Baldwin you're going to be uncomfortable all right

Speaker 13 00:23:37.680
If you watch the first breeze of summer there's nothing in that to disturb anybody except you black people were disturbed by it If you read John Williams you're going to be uncomfortable And I think the American society it is not any longer this goes for a great many blacks as well as whites want to be made uncomfortable by black not a black dramatists by dramatists for some reason or another I have ceased making people very uncomfortable with the exception perhaps of the bull Ed Rollins and Rob No out

Speaker 5 00:24:12.230
Well cause I one that really relates to the way in which the arts developed I tend to have a psycho frame the critics have a lot to do with your success Your producers your backers Whereas a publishing industry controls writing and which publish the availability of money and the extent to which you can get backers supports theater and drama and dance And with the advent of so many public companies and neighborhood theaters there really are more outlets for drama But I think your point is really well taken that the dialogue the critical dialogue that exist around black writing really is not has not developed a very high level around black theater And I think that's something that people in the arts like art really should deal with now to come back to the question of how do we get more Young black How do we get more black people involved in writing and criticizing writing other than a traditional route and a very important work which you describe of going to school and learning as much as you can Still it is a question of well what do you do when you write How do you get criticized How do you get it published What do you do What's your advice to young people on that score

Speaker 3 00:25:34.900
Well first I think that any young person interested in writing should seek out a workshop

Speaker 11 00:25:42.070
There are a number of workshops in New York City and they've had various successes quite a few writers have emerged out of these workshops

Speaker 5 00:25:51.550
How does someone get in touch I know we've had John Collins for example who talked about his workshop and we've had Joan families talked about some of the things we're doing in drama Basically the way in which one finds out about these is to establish some type of contact Various people in the arts Yeah there is a Frederick Douglass creative center

Speaker 11 00:26:11.980
At one hundred and twenty ninth Street in Harlem which offers workshops and all of the writing areas from journalism on up through fiction but I I know a few of them myself but that's a good question as to how one would get into college

Speaker 5 00:26:30.490
You know what I found and this even happens to me some time that the best way is to just pick up the phone or pick up a pen right I'm a writer Certainly there are very few writers who won't smile So as I said I'd like you to come up and speak or I'd like to have you look at this piece of work because there is something contagious about people in the art to write They do want their work to be aside and they are generally very willing to criticize other people's work I might add a great many people do this too

Speaker 11 00:27:03.800
I'm sure you got manuscripts all the time I manuscripts from people that's a good point because people writers if they don't have the information or other time they certainly will will tell you or suggest places where you can go I think the workshop ideas very good idea was very productive in the latter part of the 60s and I think it's coming back primarily because the young people more and more are beginning to want to articulate their experiences and writing is a good way of doing it

Speaker 5 00:27:34.840
Now of course you did mentioned earlier the idea of a black publishing house Yes and not just a black publishing house a black publishing industry in a sense And I think that's something that really we need to spend more time thinking about

Speaker 11 00:27:47.500
Certainly there are several There are some pretty good ones are in operation now and hopefully they'll get better

Speaker 1 00:27:55.630
I know Dudley Randall has broadside at Detroit and they are two elderly Darnell Ali has third press out in Chicago Our guest on the night soul of reason has been Professor Addison Gale who's associate professor of literature at Baruch College of the city university of New York And we've been talking about the exciting world of black writing What makes it take What do we need to do to develop more black writers
