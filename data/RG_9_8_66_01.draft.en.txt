Speaker 1 00:00:01.290
Only 2 percent of those employed in the field of journalism are from minority groups Here are Pat Patterson editor at large at Black Enterprise magazine an instructor in the Association for Education and Journalism's Summer Institute for minorities discuss this important issue On tonight's soul of reason

Speaker 2 00:00:38.890
This is Soul of reason a program that will examine the roots of the black box soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University

Speaker 1 00:01:05.110
Our guest tonight soul reason is Kat Patterson who is editor at large at Black Enterprise magazine and has been very active in the field of journalism for minorities trying to find out why minorities are discriminated against and providing the training so that more of us can get into the field It's really good to have you as a guest tonight Thank you from me Rascoff Let's get into the statistical picture You say 2 percent Could you tell us something about how this 2 percent is distributed and also other than the obvious reason of racism Give us some reasons why there are so few minorities in the journalism field

Speaker 3 00:01:42.430
Well I think historically blacks have not been in journalism generally you know largely because of the extreme and discriminatory pattern in the past And I of course most black journalists came on the scene during the eruptions of the 60s and there was a spate of hiring and I think particularly in the mid 60s when the qualifications for getting a job would simply be black Well that obviously has stopped now and we do see a better trained and more black journalists entering the field but still the fact remains that despite a tremendous influx and numbers that is of blacks we still only make up 2 percent of the entire journalism field Now is this black or this blacks and other minority blacks and other minorities so I suppose if you would separate out blacks Alone you might have something like 1 1/2 percent well now where are they distributed

Speaker 4 00:02:59.050
For example we talk about the field of journalism we are talking about newspaper reporters we are talking about the radio news people we talk my television newspaper my people who write for the news magazines in the news weeklies and I guess you are talking about some of the people who have public relations type responsibilities with the various business and social and governmental agencies right

Speaker 5 00:03:21.460
I suppose in sheer numbers just in terms of numbers blacks or blacks and minorities are better represented in print that is newspapers and magazines although the the the number for magazines is is pitifully low They are more visible on television But here again they there is a certain amount of visibility But in terms of numbers That still is quite small So the the the larger number of blacks you'll find on newspapers But even here when you figure that papers like The New York Times or The L.A. Times have upward of 300 people on their staff and maybe about 10 15 perhaps 20 blacks on their staff you can understand that we still are represented even on these papers where there has been some considerable hiring during the past

Speaker 4 00:04:30.380
Now getting to the end of the car and the general idea of racism which certainly isn't a major factor What are some of the other things subtle and otherwise that tend to keep more minorities from getting into the journalism field

Speaker 5 00:04:47.530
Well I don't think it's so much subtle t anymore I think in the beginning obviously blacks were not encouraged to enter the field simply because there were no jobs But during the last five or six years I suppose there has been a tremendous increase in the number of blacks entering the field of journalism And I suppose simply the lure of television itself with its its enormous appeal And it's frankly it's a glamour appeal in many instances it has attracted a number of blacks But there was a study not too long ago that Senate that concluded that one reasons most journalists black or white enter The field of journalism is to make a change I mean they really don't do it for money It comes out of some kind of sense of idealism and an A and a need to change And I think that whereas the jobs are limited in in majority media it is my hope that perhaps some of this training will be reflected or some of this new interest in journalism among blacks minorities will be reflected in a strong minority press which I think is essential to the future of my community

Speaker 6 00:06:13.000
Matter of fact I was the next question I was going to ask because you said that blacks have not had a long heritage in the press Immediately I thought back to John Rush worms Freedom Press which is the first black newspaper and freedom journal he called it and Frederick Douglass is Northstar and Monroe tried this paper talk about the vans and the Murphys and all those great black newspapers the Koreas in the sense that the defenders and the Afro American chain and our own New York graphs Nam news Powell and then broke hope

Speaker 7 00:06:49.090
So there I find I believe there are some but two or three hundred black weeklies around the country

Speaker 6 00:06:56.510
Yes there are headed by the I was at the Association of Negro NEWSNIGHT National Negro Publishers Association he called them Goodlatte write those songs so that there is some affinity for the use of the press of the written word to project the message and concern of blacks The problem which I think you're relating to is that despite all of these numbers the black press is still relatively weak It is relatively weak press depends upon advertising it depends on circulation

Speaker 7 00:07:26.770
And most black people still get their news from the major white daily in whatever urban or suburban community they live in And I think one of the real problems with that is that we

Speaker 5 00:07:41.740
Frequently get a distorted picture of of our communities Now sometimes that's not always intentional On the other hand sometimes that biases is intended but I think that the only way in which the many needs of the black community are going to be realized and satisfied is if that if we have a stronger communication vehicle which is controlled and directed by by people who are intimately concerned with those problem which turns out of course to be black people Well this would suggest that one thing that blacks might do

Speaker 7 00:08:20.860
Is to do the kind of thing that inner city broadcasting is done with radio to take a couple of radio stations in this instance

Speaker 8 00:08:27.430
You have in New York City maybe I like being that PBL SFM which really are black control but because of the way in which they are programmed they begin to influence larger audiences Of course part of this relates to the use of music which really isn't exactly news but conceivably Black control of one of the major dailies might help I think the largest black publishing organization is Johnson Publishing and Ebony is a targeted publication which is the main publication jet is a targeted publication by the IS on core has tried to cover a wider publication a wide readership but generally their readership tends to be a little bit more closely a black readership What can we do to get some black control of some of the major news sources

Speaker 5 00:09:22.840
Well I think the argument becomes circular Roscoe The publishers obviously need the advertising to improve their product and they cannot improve their product with without the advertising so it becomes a kind of circular question of what comes first the chicken or the egg But I do believe that if Black publications are to attract The kind of audience it needs number one in terms of structure circulation and to in terms of advertising it simply has to improve its product and obviously that means better trained young black journalists who are willing to come in and to to work on black newspapers and somehow that accommodation must be met by the owners and publishers of black magazines If that's going to happen the reason I say this that is this that there is in my opinion not a single influential black newspaper In the country and I say that With a great deal of sadness because I think that it particularly in in our major cities where considerable amount of that population is black and minority that there is no communication vehicle which influences the policies and strategies of the office holders And I think until and unless that situation has changed that I'm afraid that blacks will be in the same dependency situation that we've been in for so long

Speaker 8 00:11:14.940
Know one of the things you've been active in for the past four or five years is the association in education for journalism summer minority program which is run at New York University in conjunction with the journalists department and our own Institute of Afro-American affairs What impact do you think this program has had on dealing with the problem of minorities in journalism Well I think it's been a very good program as you know and I think that a great deal of credit must go of course to yourself and to Dr. Lionel Barrow who is the dean of communications school communications at Howard the program in my opinion has been extremely successful not only because of the minority students that who participate in the program but because of their commitment To seeing change and some of course will have elected to indicate that they want to go back in and more naughty press others want to go into majority press but almost all of them want to go on

Speaker 5 00:12:26.850
Either in either media to make a difference they believe they can make a change And I think that the youngsters who come through that program are committed To better minority representation

Speaker 8 00:12:40.620
For some young people who are listening and people who have been trained in journalism

Speaker 6 00:12:45.270
Maybe you made it then defy how they might go about actually getting a job where they might follow up some of the possibilities I know you have a couple of particular ideas on this but you've developed those for us

Speaker 5 00:12:58.890
Well I think the the the first thing that any young journalists should do is is to to know where the jobs are and too often those jobs and not New York or San Francisco well L.A. but that they should be first concerned about getting a job perhaps in a small town or some where outside of a major city they do not need to start at the top Obviously they should be well trained And I think that if they were interested and if they were interested in a specialty that they should concentrate in that area they should concentrate on urban affairs or labor And I think that if they bring a particular skill to a newspaper they have an opportunity of a better opportunity in heart than if they were simply a general interest reporter

Speaker 8 00:14:06.330
We're talking with Pat Patterson I have a large black enterprise magazine about opportunities for minorities in the field of journalism and how the journalism field itself can serve the minority community more effectively And one of the things that I'm interested in in is the development of these new wire and radio service type organizations serving the major press but also serving a sense of the black community in thinking of things like community news service which I understand is having some problems and may be going out of business National Black network mutual black network Do you think these type of services helped to get the position of the minority community across better Do you think that they will be able to survive For example CNS is already in trouble National Black network is at least moving along mutual black network which is really a subsidiary of a larger white owned corporation seems to be serving a lot of black radio stations What do you think about these developments

Speaker 9 00:15:13.580
Well I think they are good developments unfortunately because of the enormous amount of capital that's needed to put these services together blacks have not been operating at anywhere near optimum But I do believe the market is there And unfortunately an organization like Community News Service which is In deep financial trouble and has been operating for some years may have to fold because it has not been able to get the necessary funding but the service itself obviously is a good one and a much needed one but it has not been able to get the support of enough backers because of their shaky financial situation Now what the radio wire services I think we see a little better picture national black network is is doing well They uh they were funded at a reasonable level financed at a reasonable level and they are now doing well and they are looking forward to some expansion neutral black network work News of course has is doing well and that too has been largely because it's been financed properly So I think there is not only a need but a continued need for such services

Speaker 7 00:16:55.520
Well you know the example that you just gave about mutual black network and national black network and the success of your own magazine Maybe you were affiliated with Black Enterprise The success of Ebony The success of essence with the black woman's magazine Suggests that the black press or the black media that are targeted mainly to black concerns and a marketed properly Are going to be successful

Speaker 6 00:17:27.650.0000000001164
But it doesn't seem to deal with that other problem you're talking about and that is media which are black controlled have black input and present the black perspective which cover the larger population Do you think that's going to be possible Well I think that a publication or any media effort that's that's directed towards

Speaker 9 00:17:55.850
The black community can succeed If if if you have all the proper ingredients as that is the three M's money management and the market Now obviously there is a market for black publications I think Black Enterprise Essence and Ebony have demonstrated that fact But then to we need to have the proper amount of funding You just simply not cannot start on a shoestring I think those days are over by and large And then of course there's much needed ingredients management And I think that if you can get that proper combination that you're going to have a successful product I think that the black market is a dormant market It is a market that needs to be cultivated And I think it will be Will appreciate considerably in the future And I think it anyone who is perceptive enough to to understand the dynamic so that market can be very successful in any venture not just the media venture but if he is he or she is is understands that market and its potential that they can realize a very good opportunity

Speaker 8 00:19:22.540
Well one of the things I know that you do is you teach the Course in Journalism and minorities for the association education and journalism summer program is to plan with the students so that they produce a magazine

Speaker 6 00:19:36.490
I believe this year what's the title of this kaleidoscope Kaleidoscope they have names it's been Genesis 1 It's a spectrum it's been still here And again as part of their experience the students in the program select the name of the well that's the whole line

Speaker 10 00:19:51.430
It should be not the magazine of some form a class but the magazine of that class it should reflect the the ideas and the perceptions and the wants and the simply the feeling of that particular group of students they have produced that magazine We were fortunate this year to to get the services of a few professionals who have agreed to help design the magazine and to shoot for the magazine So it has taken on what we've always been working towards that is to to a melding of the professionals and the students And this year we will as all year we manage to get a number of Really top notch black professionals to come down and speak with the youngsters like less pain of Newsday one of the few black Pulitzer Prize winners came down to chat with us And Gil Noble of course was there and that Samuels of community news service so we've had a variety of people who have come in and tried to share this experience with us And that's another thing that these young people get exposed to what the real world is all about when they are allowed to rub shoulders a little bit with some of these

Speaker 11 00:21:12.910
Top black professional things interesting for the audience to note that the participants in the summer journalism program for minorities come from all over the country and they're not only black but they are Native Americans and they are Chicanos they are Puerto Ricans or Asian-Americans and they are selected from some I believe this year was 280 applicants from the various journalism departments throughout the country which really means you have the cream of the crop and as we said Super youngsters too they really are very good And many of them have gone ahead to be in the media Just recently I was in Washington D.C. and I heard a reporter giving a report on the radio and who was it But Paula quick who had been in the program three or four years ago and it and I was also in a news conference and one of the other young people get the name right now came up to me to say hi You remember me from the AJ workshop So this suggests that people like yourself And organizations like AJ an institution like New York University can do something to help develop a pool of skilled journalists Now the fact is that they're probably a much larger pool of skilled journalists than they are job opportunities But again you're suggesting that quite possibly creative management and creative planning can pull these people together so that we can produce more publications that will meet the needs of a minority community and as well the majority community And my view is that the majority press is served well by having minority people who understand truly the minority situation on their staff

Speaker 10 00:22:57.320
Well Roscoe that's absolutely true because what we're seeing throughout the country is one and two paper towns where before we used to have five or six newspapers we now get all of our information from three networks or two newspapers And usually those that media is owned by a single entity So we are seeing a kind of monopolistic control of the media now It's it's up to now it's been benign by and large but still it has not been totally representative of the various ethnic and racial groups in many cities And it seems to me that if with programs like AJ in which trained really skilled young people can come out and begin to exert some influence in the world of journalism that we're all going to be better for it And so that being said the same kind of news from the same sources with the same restrictions Despite however well-intentioned they might be

Speaker 11 00:24:12.610
I might mention if anyone in the audience is interested in the AJ summer internship program they should contact the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University The address is 70 Washington Square s New York 112 and ask for information about the program One of the things that I know that you're doing and I know in my capacity as director of the Institute I'm doing is to publicize the program more let people know about both the need and the success of the program so that we can get more sponsors because the way in which the program works is that the young people come to New York and they work with various media organizations that we place people at Women's Day at faucet publications at Newsweek magazine called buyer associates act of Equitable Life associates We've had interns at the National Urban League community news service and a variety of media organizations like that and more sponsors we have The more we can serve the needs both of the minority students and the minority community but also the needs of the majority of newspapers the majority radio station the majority group magazines because I'm really glad that I can only say amen to that Roscoe because I don't really think that Without such programs a J which is one of two minority such programs in the country and that alone is a disgrace which which is really a disgrace because most of the young blacks do need some kind of assistance in getting through school number one and I do need some

Speaker 10 00:25:57.160
Particular help in finding their way to to to employment And the program does that and I think it's it's it's uh it's a it's a very narrow view of the that's taken by some business groups when they reject an opportunity to do two parts just to participate in this kind of program

Speaker 11 00:26:18.820
One of the things that I've found in attempting to sell a program to various sponsors is that someone is a sort of a poverty program you know doing things just to help minorities because it's a good social thing to do And the point that we've tried to develop and some of the majority group media people who've worked with us have tried to emphasize that it's good business for a majority publication to have minority people on the staff and to train a large number of minority people because this gives them a larger pool of qualified people to sell absolutely and I think that the business community must reject this whole sociological view of of of assisting those who have historically been disadvantaged

Speaker 10 00:27:04.060
I think that the same that's the same sort of thinking is what contributes to the deterioration of our cities because I think not in terms of a productive person but rather in terms of some dependent person And until that kind of thinking is is no more I'm afraid that we're going to continue and are

Speaker 11 00:27:25.500
Growing again as we come to the close of program What advice would you give to young people who want to minority young people who want to enter the field of journalism

Speaker 10 00:27:35.560
I think they ought to give themselves a little extra I would suggest that they attempt to specialize in something and so that they get their foot in the door If they are trained as in political science or as movie critic or book critic or they know urban affairs I think they ought to give themselves an edge which gets them through the door and brings they bring a special talent to that paper

Speaker 12 00:28:08.620
And I think the that publication or that network would be eager to hire again spoken with the excellence that Pat Patterson has brought to our minority journalism program at New York University
