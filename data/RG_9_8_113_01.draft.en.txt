Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University

Speaker 1 00:01:04.160
With us this evening on soul of reason is author Barnes who is president of the New York Urban Coalition and is a well known fighter for the rights of all people in New York City Glad to have you with us tonight A pleasure to be with you Dr. Brown

Speaker 4 00:01:17.540
Well since you were last on the program a few months ago a lot of things have happened in New York City One of those things is that one of our colleagues the honorable Percy Sutton is announcing for candidacy as mayor of the city Another thing is big mac is back on the drawing board and trying to solve some of the financial problems and still another thing is that there's a court decision that says that the bondholders after repaid the million dollars that are owed to them by the city So with all of these things happening and we put on top of that the worst winter we've had in 200 years of the republic with all of those things happening How do you as a president of the private agency that speaks for the poor and the minorities of the city look at where we stand what does 1977 look like to you and what are some of the things the coalition is doing to try to deal with some of these problems

Speaker 5 00:02:15.080
I wish I could be optimistic but as you describe the terrible state of affairs that we find ourselves in in New York City I have to say to you that I think it will get worse before it gets better All of the elements involved in the parameters of the problem in New York City that we all face as New Yorkers point to that I think that that is going to be a fact And certainly the fiscal condition of the city itself has not improved to any appreciable degree Add to that the terrible fiscal condition that the state is in And I think that what we have are the elements for continued financial problems for the next foreseeable future

Speaker 4 00:02:58.700
And of course the brunt of these problems is placed on the poor No question about it And the thing that I find so interesting as we look at the problems in New York City somehow or another we get some money and I think it's desirable that these men get rehired or rehire firemen and policemen But we don't seem to get money to rehire teachers or to keep daycare centers open or to provide for drug addiction counselors and the like Why is this and what are some of the things that we as citizens might do to try to deal with these

Speaker 5 00:03:31.400
I think that that's an interesting question that you raised Actually it's just a statement of fact not a question because certainly that is what the reality is today One of the reasons that we at the Coalition address those insoluble problems and let me try to enumerate some of our objectives for 1977 in 77 we're going to address three problem areas One is in housing one is in education and the other is in an area that we characterize as community outreach community outreach is the area that's the catch all of the human services that you've just enunciated as parts of the problem When you say why is it that there is not enough money in either city or state budgets to address the problems of poor people I think that one of the reasons is a lack of commitment on the part of the legislators and a lack of organizational clout on the part of the victims of those decisions that cut essential services Let me enunciate that a little further as an example The New York Urban Coalition has convened a New York State Task Force on Drug Abuse that is now in the process of trying to educate legislators on a city and state level not to cut the State Drug Abuse budget nine point six million dollars And with this description of this effort I think we'll get all of the elements of your statement in it Roscoe what has happened is that over the past three years in this one area alone statewide all of the drug providers the drug abuse facility providers have been cut 40 percent and this goes across modality lines

Speaker 6 00:05:33.800
The task force that we have put together for the first time includes all of the modalities and heretofore they had been fragmented and fighting among themselves You know the old argument Divide and conquer That's right Drug Free is better than methadone methadone is better than school prevention right on down the line But now for the first time the threat is so great that all of these modalities on a statewide basis have come together to address the problem and the problem with in caps is that nine point six million dollars is going to have such a terrible effect on our society within the state that not only are these drug program is going to be put out of business but the drug addicts themselves which who incidentally for the first time in many many years certainly since 1971 are looking for treatment in drug treatment centers And there was a time in 71 when there were openings and there were no addicts that were attracted to the Centers and now for the first time these centers are over their capacity so that if they are forced to be turned away then they go into the criminal justice system because to go back to the streets means to go back to drug addiction which means to support that habit they have to commit crimes And statistics have showed and these are the state's own statistics that shows that an addict that is not in treatment and who is involved in crime and who is free and our society costs the citizens of this state twenty five thousand dollars as compared to twenty four hundred dollars a year If they are in treatment So to cut all of the drug agencies by an additional nine point six million dollars means that all of us will be feeling the burden of these multiplied effects so that our pocketbooks are going to be hit and hit time and time again renews our pocketbook

Speaker 7 00:07:36.190
You mean to the effect of crime to the effect of crime and to the taxes that we pay which must pay for the services either in a correctional institution or in a drug addiction agency is we have sort of a circle which goes back to a larger financial crisis in New York City New York City's move toward fiscal stability has been handicapped somewhat by the fact that the state which was providing a certain amount of money now says that they can't provide that same amount of money the state budget which was beginning to approach a deficit point is in a process of being cut so they can maintain the taxes at a certain level So all of a sudden the state then says at least that it doesn't have money for these kind of programs to with the drug program certain education programs So the question when I asked you then is are you advocating that the state take money away from something else and put it into the drug programs Are you advocating that the state increase its taxes so that they can have the money for these would full recognition of the fact that when you increase taxes at least in places like New York City in New York State you tend to drive away business So I'm really asking the question and deals with the whole circle

Speaker 6 00:08:56.490
Well what you what you've just outlined is certainly the dilemma that that the legislators and the governor faces

Speaker 8 00:09:03.540
What I am saying in answer to that is that there are certain priorities that must be given to human services in this state and in this city there is no doubt that there are claims on a limited amount of money that and each one of them can be designated as essential I'm talking now about Medicaid I'm talking about social services welfare I'm talking about daycare centers and I'm talking about drug addiction agencies to balance out each need against each other is a very cynical approach that our legislators and in fact our government officials from the governor's office right down are adopting And I think that this callous cynical approach goes this way In fact they have stated so to me in the office of the budget of the state when I was in Albany within the last week to discuss this terrible situation when they were we were addressing the cuts in drug addiction services when the budget people can say we don't care so much about the recidivism with drug addicts because they will go back to county jails and we don't fund county jails We only fund the state facilities and then to me this This isn't a perfect example of the cynicism that they view these very grave human problems They tried the legislators in their political gamesmanship Try to balance out the demands of each group Each constituency they say they have said to the daycare people we have pledged to restore drug addiction money and therefore we must take it from the daycare people the daycare people then come to the task force and say Why did you press your case at our expense The Medicaid people who have been cut the Department of the aged who deals with those older citizens say how can you give to the daycare centers and not to us so they play one against the other And this is the kind of callousness that is exhibited by our legislators and by our public officials My recommendation is yes these essential human services should have high priority on our state and city budget and that each government agency must make economies within their own administration If I were to tell you on a citywide basis that a group called the Education Priorities Panel has just started an analysis of the Board of Education's budget and found that there is woeful examples of waste and mismanagement within that department and that perhaps 30 million dollars could be saved from their existing budget I'm sure you would be surprised Now this kind of examination should go on in all of our city and state agencies so that the necessary economies can be made on the top and therefore not jeopardize the kind of service provision that's given to US citizens who are in so such bad shape

Speaker 9 00:12:16.040
I think that's a very eloquent defense of or really advocacy statement of the needs for services people how this should be met On the other hand it doesn't really square exactly with the economic realities of New York State I read just the other day that New York State alone had lost one hundred and thirty five thousand jobs in the past year more than any other state in the nation When when you lose that number of jobs obviously you not only lose the income and the tax revenue from those workers but also you create needs for additional service moneys The suggestion that usually is given let's go down to Washington and get the money in order to provide the services The argument about you present about agencies serving money is almost exactly the argument that was directed at the Health and Hospitals Corporation when there was the concern about replacing Dr. Holliman that in fact he could have saved money and what in fact he says that yeah maybe we could save a little bit but basically the needs far outweigh whatever we could save to some administrative savings So let's really bring the right noun upfront to the problem that has been facing New York City in the past year and a half well namely the outflow of jobs and economic resource that in the past has made New York City the economic and financial and marketing capital of the nation if not the world is still continuing and that same time we have an outmigration of the people who are producing income and in migration because of the reputation in New York City has for providing human services and having a big hoard of people who require services So we're almost in a Catch 22 situation We have a situation where literally there is demand and need actual need for more service Yet there's increasingly smaller amounts of tax resources and other economic resource to provide these services And this is what has led some people to say New York City is in a state of crisis and unless it comes up with another way of managing its affairs in all types of programs in terms of the way in which it funds them or the way in which these services are provided by funding the city will not survive as a major city How do you react to that type of analysis Because I think it's an analysis that has been made frequently just before you answer that although I'd like to mention that we're talking with author bonds president of the New York Urban Coalition We're talking about the problem of New York City and some of the approaches that might be used in dealing with those problems

Speaker 5 00:15:08.360
So maybe you can now respond to that particular catch 22 dilemma that we find ourselves in and my right my response is certainly to embellish your statement because while it's been one hundred and thirty five thousand jobs in 1976 in the past five years it has been it is total now of over 600000 jobs that have been lost in New York City

Speaker 10 00:15:34.500
And let's look at why that happens companies move out for various reasons Nine times out of ten I think it has been proven that it is the executive administration that decides to move And usually that's because of some personal reason either they themselves live in Darian Connecticut and find it difficult to get in or else they hear that some of their employees are having difficulty using the subway or they use another reason that it's very difficult to import high level management personnel into New York City because of the problems that exist within our city and therefore they find a better climate when they go to the outskirts whether it's Westchester or in New Jersey or Connecticut Now this has been happening in an ever widening circle Let's look at why this happens Certainly New York City if we say that and as studies have said that the chief problem for companies moving out of New York City is education public education or the lack of it and crime Now if we look at both of those areas we find that these are the problems that are uppermost on the minds of citizens that live here and certainly through the publicity that New York City has received over the years through the media and television programs everyone looks at New York as Sin City Now to some extent that is true But as these companies move out because of these basic human problems that are found not only in New York City but in every large metropolis of our nation and I think the reason that they do finally move out is because these problems are not addressed in a concrete way by those who are making the decisions in our city administration and in our state administration What I mean is this that if we address the problems of the poor we address the problems of corporations who bring business here and provide jobs here If we have a cycle of high employment if we have a top priority to get the best public education system that our money can provide and you work you well know Dr. Brown that New York spends New York City specifically spends more money on education than the majority of states in this country And yet we are turning out functional illiterates Who is to blame New inhabitants of New York City when they declined to have their children go to our public schools Who is to blame them for saying that the streets are not safe when in fact the streets are not safe But just as it is their option not to come here Those of us who are here with no options must suffer now certain things can be done I believe to rectify this because not only do we have the brainpower we do have the resources Even if our budgetary situation is as poor as it is we are providing those services We are not providing leadership We are not coming up with innovative ways or creative ways to address these new social problems and our schools don't teach Now those are the elements that we must deal with and I think those that those are the reasons that these problems are not being solved in any way shape or form

Speaker 9 00:19:08.200
Well of course again you sort of elucidated and widen the circle somewhat For example in terms of the allegation that schools don't teach it is certainly true that people who come to the city with diminished educational backgrounds for their age not that they are unable to learn but thus far they haven't learned and also have developed certain behavior patterns related to the way in which they adjust to the city do put increased pressures on the schools So what the schools have tended to do is to try to spend more money and get more specialists to deal with these problems and it's worked a little bit but it really hasn't worked a great deal And what the school authority will say will look basic it's a problem of the community There's not enough economic stability and then we bring the circle right on back to the question of economics Now one of the things that you and I are both aware of and that is that borough president Percy Sutton of Manhattan has announced that the candidate for mayor is probably the first black politician who has opted to challenge the political structure for the morality for the nomination and run on the Democratic ticket To what extent do you think it will make any difference whether there's a black mayor or a white mayor in terms of dealing with these problems until such time as we get a better social system a better I'll use the term management and planning system which cuts across both the private sector and the public sector To what extent do you think it'll really make a difference or do you think that it will make a difference even as if just symbolically

Speaker 10 00:20:55.630
I think that it will make a difference But in that question that you just posed There are many many elements Let me deal with the first one first and that was with the educational system that the students the present population within our schools which at present count is 65 percent black and Hispanic because that population has changed and because they bring many problems that the system which was established at the turn of the 20th century is not able now to deal with that A lot of innovative approaches must be made at great expense Now that certainly has the elements of truth but it doesn't tell the entire picture what actually has happened is that we have created within the Board of Education a monolithic organization whose chief priority is its own self perpetuation

Speaker 11 00:21:47.080
The teachers as they have become more and more work men and women within the trade union movement has looked upon this new school population with their deficiencies and with their differences And no one has added and with their strengths and creativity that they might be able to contribute if developed and they look at them as individuals who cannot learn and therefore the opposite of that is that the teachers now need not make an attempt to teach They are then involved in custodial care merely keeping the youngsters with some semblance of order however diminish that may be between 9 and 3 Now it seems to me that if this is the approach that we're using the same old approach that we're using to education and which we are not changing except for a few demonstration projects then the end product is going to remain the same The other part of the question is do you think that Percy Sutton's candidacy for mayor will make a difference and if he is elected mayor as the New York City's first black mayor Will that make a difference Yes I believe that it will make a difference in two very important ways Number one Percy Sutton is an eminently qualified candidate to be mayor And if elected will be a mayor for all of the people of the city of New York And I think that his record in the as the Manhattan borough president for the last 12 years shows that anyone who has been down to the Board of Estimate seeing the leadership that he exerts there and the the way his colleagues react to him and seek his leadership will recognize this man's outstanding ability What's more important though if he is elected mayor is that his perspective of the problems of New York will be given a different and unique approach I think that his set of priorities would be different because his perspective of those problems would be different than that which we have seen in many many years if ever in the city's administration And that's why I think that as mayor he would make a difference

Speaker 9 00:23:57.350
What do you think that he has a chance to win

Speaker 10 00:24:02.080
That's very difficult to prognosticate at this point I think that he has a strong presents a strong candidate candidacy for the mayoralty race and I think that if the proper organization and most importantly the proper funding of a serious candidacy for the mayoralty is made then he has an excellent chance

Speaker 12 00:24:25.150
You also well-known in the community as one of the so-called 100 Black Men an organization of outstanding black leaders throughout the city I believe you the president the vice president organization Yes I am To what extent do these influential 400 some odd men represent a significant force for change for better in the city of New York

Speaker 11 00:24:56.110
I think that the the 100 Black Men's organization is an important organization within the city because of the membership which do whose mobilization provides the clout by which the organization speaks You are certainly aware of the fact that the organization is consulted on appointments on city state and federal level They are consulted when decisions are going to be made that obviously affect the black community and their input is received when they become advocates for particular points of view that have impact on the black community The fact that these successful individuals have mobilized within this organization then provides an amount of clout in the power structure They are listened to and they are asked questions that affect the black community Now the overall goals of the organization itself is to provide this kind of leadership Now what seems to me to be the source of solution to some of our minority problems is that this kind of organizational effort and mobilization must exist on various levels within our society so that we build become together not only as a united black community but with the other minority communities so that our needs are met by the establishment

Speaker 12 00:26:19.930
But what about the allegation that black organizations that are essentially middle class like the one in black men the organization 100 Black Women tend to advocate things that are good for the masses but not necessarily deal with them themselves For example the whole question about education most of the middle class black people in Manhattan send their children to private schools In the case of crime many of the spokesmen of these organizations are not as active as they might be in the campaign against crime not you particularly because your organization has been one of the leaders probably the leader in the fight against crime What about this Is there sort of a class difference that is diminishing the potential leadership role that these organizations might play in mobilizing the black community

Speaker 11 00:27:19.770
I think that the black community in New York City is no different than any other ethnic or racial group We are Americans and as such there we are subject to the class distinctions that all Americans have been subjected to I think that we should have a clearer view of what our mission is because our responsibility in the middle class to the underclass is greater in the black community than it is in any other ethnic group Since we have been traditionally low men on the totem pole none of us can ascend that ladder of success without helping and bringing his brother up And when that message gets across blacks in New York City and in the country we'll be more unified to solve their problems and with a man like Arthur vines articulating that message in lean Urban Coalition

Speaker 12 00:28:11.670
I really do think that New York City has a hopeful future Our guest on tonight sole reason has been author bonds is president of the New York Urban Coalition and we've been talking about the problems of New York City potential solutions to the problems the upcoming candidacy of President Percy Sutton for the morality of New York City and the role of organizations like the 100 Black Men and helping to deal with the problems of the black community and New York City Thanks again Arthur for being I guess my pleasure
