Paul Robeson was one of our legendary black heroes The Paul Robeson archives are now being organized by a group of distinguished people headed by Paul Robeson Junior Hear him discuss the Paul Robeson archives on tonight's soul of reason This is Soul of reason A program that will examine the roots of the black box

Speaker 2 00:00:44.310
Soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University

Speaker 1 00:01:04.920
Our guest on tonight sole reason is Paul Robeson Junior who is heading up the development of the Paul Robeson archives And Paul first would like to welcome you to our show tonight Glad to have you with us Thank you And I also want to congratulate you on a recent fundraiser that you had at Carnegie Hall

Speaker 3 00:01:23.550
The artists salute to Paul Robeson which I hope raise some money for the archives

Speaker 4 00:01:30.120
And then I'd like you to begin by just telling us what you feel the purpose the main purpose of the Paul Robeson archives is

Speaker 5 00:01:39.720
Well the purpose of the archives is to assemble all of the material by honor about Paul Robeson in one place in its proper context And there is an enormous amount of material that we already have for example especially in areas that people are not very familiar with My father among other things was a great scholar I mean he knew some 24 languages He read enormous numbers of books on the cultures of peoples all over the world and he created a significant body of writing His own writing all of which has been preserved including vast correspondence between him and people all over the world and in the United States Many of the great Renaissance figures like Dr. Dubois great musicians of the resonant Renaissance period And so we have we are in the process of organizing all this material cataloging it so that it can be made available to people all over this country and all over the world Our aim is to put it in a major black institution where it can be properly housed and particularly can be made through microfilm and other means available to people in libraries schools around the country

Speaker 3 00:03:11.730
And of course that is a monumental job to pull together the papers of any person who's lived in the public domain is difficult but pull together the papers and artifacts and the concerns of someone as great as your father is just a monumental task And of course this requires money requires money for the very very time consuming assiduous job of cataloging and putting them into an appropriate location And so that scholars can reach in and do the cross referencing I know that there's a project that a black historian named John blessing game is doing on the Frederick Douglass papers I also know that there has been a project dealing with the WB the boy's papers which has fallen on the shelves of legal concerns between his widow Shirley Graham Dubois and some of the other people had some of the other papers I gather in your instance at least at the present time you haven't had any particular problem gaining access to most of the papers and works of your father

Speaker 6 00:04:26.280
Is that correct That's correct as a matter of fact the basic collection was kept through the years by my mother who died some 12 years ago but kept more or less the entire collection intact And as far as other papers other tapes film people in general have been very cooperative in providing us either in some cases with originals but in other cases with adequate copies which are adequate for our purposes So we've had a great deal of cooperation except there is a great deal of material that during the 1950s the so-called McCarthy period was confiscated by various agencies of the United States government and they are have not and are not being cooperative in the sense that they haven't released the material including a great deal of film We are demanding that the family is demanding that through the Freedom of Information I was about to say and we laid out how we shall persevere in that and of course people should be made aware that a great amount of material has been confiscated in that manner and any pressures that they bring to bear on the powers that be of course will be helpful in that respect

Speaker 7 00:05:44.200
And of course aside from the fact that to any of us who grew up with the image of your father above us in front of us you know there's only one person you talk about I was in sports I was an athlete mission etc. The person you wanted to be like was Paul it because that was the black Superman in a sense not only in terms of his athletic endeavors in his scholarly endeavors artistic endeavors but also his commitment to human dignity And unfortunately because of the way in which the country moved in the late 40s really and in the 50s we have this almost it isn't an 18 minute gap on the tape it's almost like an 18 year gap on the tape where specific efforts were taken to besmirch Paul Robeson's name and certain specific acts were done such as pulling back his passport conscious grading papers and so on which really is a blight on American democracy and freedom of information act certainly should help to break this But I was wondering because one of the sad things about a society is that very few people are really truly recognized for their significance while they are alive It's only afterwards that all of a sudden people were critical in this and that begin to say ah wait person So what I was wondering if you found much of that as you've gone about organizing the campaign to develop the archives have you found much of people now saying well look I was wrong or even if they didn't say they were wrong they are finally recognizing the real significance of the life of your father

Speaker 6 00:07:32.440
Well I think partly because of events and before his death I think the process of recognition had begun and I think the crucial factor was the increased awareness of their own history among black people of many generations in this country I think it's an aftermath of the civil rights movement and I think that the pressure from all segments of the black community compelled the public at large to record to begin to recognize the significance of my father's life so that history itself Before his death it began that process I think it's accelerated census death and what the issues that he posed for the society remain and they remain in the new context as controversial as they were And people's response to his life takes that into account I do not think that the powers that be who attempted to erase him from history and the media that they control I do not believe that at root their attitude has changed now their tactics may have changed but the challenge that he posed to the foundations of racism in this society its economic political and cultural foundations remains as a fundamental and severe challenge And I think their reaction to it is still of course week after week as we do

Speaker 4 00:09:10.750
So the reason we get examples of the virulence of racism we also get examples of great struggles against it

Speaker 7 00:09:21.460
And as you might note some successes you're right The base at least in my opinion the basic roots still remain And that's the reason why a figure like Paul Robeson remains ever so much to be studied because out of your struggles and out of your oppressions and your battles against oppression you do gain some insights into not only the reality of the situation but some strategies or counter strategies that might be involved in this because your father in a sense was a tremendously multifaceted person He cut across the worlds of sports and he cut across the worlds of scholarship worlds of entertainment world politics as you began to construct these archives have you found more cooperation from one segment of his life's base than the other has the entertainment field been more responsible the sports field or the education field or the political field How has this response been developed

Speaker 8 00:10:25.270
I think the response has been has been good across the board I think people who who have information on my father who were associated with him in one way or another have come would both here and abroad and have been really very helpful For example when it comes to tape film I mean agencies like the British Broadcasting Corporation Russian documentary film television French television whoever have been very very co-operative Many of the African countries Caribbean countries have volunteered and sent information from their archives and so on

Speaker 6 00:11:10.440
As I say the only problem we have had strangely enough even take film We have the anomaly that vastly more film has been acquired by the archives from abroad from sources like the source I mentioned than from the United States The problem once again is that the many Much of that material audio and video material has been was actually confiscated during the McCarthy years So to to sum up as far as individuals or institutions go Basically here and abroad we've had great cooperation

Speaker 3 00:11:47.100
All right let's tell our audience about how they might help monetarily Helping with collecting some of the material including giving us your address and your phone number That's very important You want to get in touch right

Speaker 8 00:12:03.330
Well there are two levels first of all of course knowledge about material of any kind whether they be home tape recordings radio for example programs which there were many of during the 1940s and 1930s film of all kinds of documentary and otherwise and documents letters Anyone with knowledge of things like that if they would communicate with us would be excellent And of course we always need funds We've had to rely basically on individual contributions income from public events like this tribute Monday night and from various small foundations

Speaker 9 00:12:48.600
But what is your address Yes

Speaker 6 00:12:52.470
1 5 7 West 57 Street New York New York 1 0 0 1 9 And our phone number is area code 2 1 2 2 6 5 6 2 6 0 6 0 5 6 2 6 0 6 2 6 0

Speaker 10 00:13:08.670
That's upon robes and all kinds of pull ups and archives and that's for individuals who want to give financial contributions

Speaker 7 00:13:14.850
I have some materials that they would want to donate to the archives or who wish to know about information on pull ups and whether you get it because that is one of the things we want to talk about and that is that even as you are collecting this I imagine there are some scholars who are using the archives

Speaker 8 00:13:32.580
Is that correct That's true We have developed a listing of materials that are available both from us and from other sources and we've provided materials to many libraries to documentary filmmakers who've done two films already and another one is being worked on

Speaker 5 00:13:51.870
People who want material to write doctorate theses many other things as much of this research is being done

Speaker 11 00:13:59.580
I imagine some people are thinking about films Whenever you have a great figure and the figure passes away people rush to say well let's do a film one person to film obviously the life of your father so significant that it lends itself to many different portrayals and interpretations How do you plan to handle that I'm sure you must have had several approaches How do you plan to look into that Because I know it's just a monumental undertaking to be involved in that project

Speaker 12 00:14:36.000
Well of course we have been approached by from by many different sources but our primary consideration is to really organize this collection and make it available to the public as task number one And I think other things really rest in a certain sense on that because for a film or you know a series of recordings or whatever to appear they should appear in context and the archives provides that context not in terms of what others say about my father so much but what he himself said Rohde did and it's portrayed in every risk and every nuance in every way In film on film on tapes in his own writings and so on So this task can be completed if we get sufficient thing quite readily in the next perhaps as soon as six months That was within a year we're confident we can have completed this task and my first consideration in terms of film is a documentary film But I think the most important thing for the American public or any other public to see is Paul Robeson as Paul Robeson It is secondary in my mind for anyone to see a fictional call ropes particularly since for almost two decades the real Paul Robeson was kept off Certainly the visual media He has never he never appeared in his entire life on American television even on a talk show only and bits of documentary or newsreel footage so that the real Paul Robeson ought to be available on film to the public before there was a fictional one And in this case people told me Well you know that the money is and is in a commercial film Well I'm not concerned with that He wasn't throughout his times when in fact he always put principle ahead of financial gain And I intend to do exactly the same thing when a film is done It should be done based on the true ropes And since I his own policy in films was he would never do a film unless he could have the final cut I will certainly never be associated with a film or Paul Robeson unless I have final cut And I think that is one of the major problems certainly in doing a studio film with the major studios which I would eliminate out of hand it would have to be done independently So I think that's a complicated and thing and down the road apiece

Speaker 4 00:17:23.599.9999999998836
I think you know cause I can easily see the reasoning behind wanting the documentary film to proceed The so-called fictional history because a recent film history is filled with films that allegedly deal with a particular person on a particular episode so much so they've even coined the new phrase in the film business a fictional history of the publishing business of fictional history which is kind of interesting How do you really do that But certainly I can see the logic behind developing a documentary Now you had suggested he had said earlier that you think you get the funding you get the project in terms of the papers and so on in place and six to eight months What type of money are you talking about if you don't mind talking about it What type of resource does it really take to do the pulling of the materials together And then of course we're going to talk about the type resource it takes to put it into a library in an appropriate place

Speaker 12 00:18:23.090
We estimate that in order to complete the job we need a total of fifty thousand dollars We've the affair the tribute the artist tribute to Paul Robeson on Monday night at Carnegie Hall has raised close to half of that So we're almost halfway there We need another 25 to 30 thousand dollars to complete the work That's what it takes

Speaker 4 00:18:49.590
Then you had indicated that you want the original materials to be in a library at a black institution in which I imagine you haven't selected at this particular point in time

Speaker 13 00:19:00.320
No we're speaking with a number of other institutions but we we think that's from our initial context We think that's quite feasible to find you know a satisfactory one within a year

Speaker 10 00:19:14.480
And at this institution you'd have to have some type of service which would monitor the collection and use and also disseminate to various other institutions and individuals materials about the collection because that's really the way in which papers of this type are used that scholars become aware of the fact they exist and they come to use them and then they talk to other scholars about it and it moves back and forth Now as you mentioned earlier the fact that some of the papers in particular some of the films are presently not available because they have been I don't know whether the confiscated is the right word but some of that practical effect they're not available to the public And you do feel that you're going to be able to get some movement on that

Speaker 14 00:20:03.830
Well that depends on the response of the various specifically the State Department the FBI the CIA and the IRS to our attorneys trying to extract information under the Freedom of Information Act for example There is a document written by President Truman forbidding Paul Robeson to cross the borders of the United States continental United States issued in 1950 including the instruction to the border person now to restrain him by any means necessary There is such a document It was read to him at the Canadian border The State Department failed to produce that during the court case for the passport saying they couldn't find it It exists somewhere and that's a historical document To my knowledge there is no such document has ever been issued on a citizen in the United States and its entire history If that citizen was not under indictment of some kind So it's sort of of historical interest So there are many documents like that As I say in this case I was diagnosed with probably will be more difficult if they have not surfaced today they'd probably be more difficult to surface than for example the films that you suggest have been confiscated or where

Speaker 4 00:21:24.470
We're taken Well what were these films that had been taken from newsreel films or were they feature films or were they documentaries or what Or were they multinational film that he had taken himself

Speaker 14 00:21:34.610
No Mostly they are newsreel footage that is missing from many newsreel libraries that many documentary film people who've tried to find material on Paul Robeson have come up with the cards and no film That is the film has been taken also Much film was shot by people like FBI agents CIA agents other people assigned to harass or to to surveillance of my father during the period from 1949 to 1958 both here and abroad As a matter of fact of which there is evidence and State Department documents and in the correspondence between our attorneys and them now it is a problem of identifying It is difficult of course for me and I cannot provide chapter and verse of such and such a date There were so many feet of film shot by Agent so-and-so of such and such a concert which is now in the file so that we have difficulty in identifying specific pieces of film and so on But It has been certainly from information that I've been able to get myself and from others there is significant amounts of film that have whether confiscated is the right word or not have been taken out of circulation through directly or indirectly through agencies of the United States government

Speaker 10 00:22:59.560
And as you describe this process of finding this it seems to me as though you're going to need a lot of resources beyond traditional research resources to get this And I would imagine that would involve some legal action in some instances as well as following up on a variety of leads that you might pick up as you do some of the other investigative work

Speaker 13 00:23:21.020
Right But I think we'll have a lot of help in that by you know people in the film media who are interested in unearthing this material Our main job is actually not an archives task but the family task Only the family can as you know request and pursue the Freedom of Information Act

Speaker 4 00:23:42.430
What do you think Have you detected a

Speaker 11 00:23:45.180
You suggested there had been some change in climate because of the civil rights movement and black awareness movement Have you detected in the general public eye a change in terms of an understanding of your father understanding of what he stood for understanding of how he had been mistreated in several instances

Speaker 13 00:24:09.730
Well I think that certainly in the public eye there's been a great increase in awareness because much more material has become available Significant amounts of documentary film have been shown on television and material recorded material has been becoming widely available so I think there is a bigger response of the public in general because when people see and hear my father so to speak on tapes on recording or in film their responses is is instantaneous and overwhelmingly good So that the problem does not lie in the public I think that the established media ranging from television networks through the august New York Times still maintain a politically hostile stance towards my father's legacy and are not about to promote that an understanding of the true meaning of that legacy because it conflicts with their own political and economic interests and standards that still I believe remain

Speaker 10 00:25:20.680
Well I think that in many ways Paul Robeson is recognized as a great scholar artist and so on but principally as a as a freedom fighter as one who had particular political beliefs which he expounded extremely well and all of the world on the other hand

Speaker 4 00:25:38.380
Paul Robeson was a significant one of the most significant figures in the entertainment world of the 20s 30s 40s and 50s What kind of response have you gotten from the entertainment industry You know the recording industry the theater industry the film industry in terms of providing material and cooperation

Speaker 13 00:26:03.580
Well I think the artists themselves have been as you know from the wonderful group of artists who who came from all over the country for the tribute to Paul Robeson Sidney Poitier Shirley Knight Carmen the love a lot and so many others who came and those who participated in the seventy fifth birthday celebration Actors Equity who as a Paul Robeson committee and who have done outstanding things to make known the legacy of Paul Robeson to two actors and actresses to the entertainment profession Many recordings have been released by the major recording companies CBS or RCA Vanguard monitor So that certainly the incident he was several years ago among the first hundred inductees to the theater hall of fame his name is among the first hundred inscribed on the wall at the Harris Theater So certainly the entertainment industry has more and more over the past I would say eight years since 1970 68 or so begun to recognize his his stature as an artist I think they're the legacy and the important legacy that he leaves is the involvement of an artist and the integrity of an artist which he is one of the pioneers in saying well as he put it the artist must elect to fight for freedom or for slavery I have made my choice I have no alternative

Speaker 1 00:27:50.710
That's a beautiful statement on which to end our program tonight Those in the audience interested in contributing to the Paul Robeson archives either in terms of material or financial support should contact the Paul Robeson archives at 157 West 57 street that's New York New York 119 or call area code 2 1 2 2 2 6 5 6 2 6 0 2 6 5 6 2 6 0 Our guest on tonight's solid reason has been Paul Robeson Junior who is heading the drive to create the Paul Robeson archives
