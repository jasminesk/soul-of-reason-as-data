Speaker 1 00:00:01.700
The stock market goes up The stock market goes down Municipal bonds are no longer popular What does all of this mean to the black community here Stephen Goodwin investment counselor discuss the significance of these developments on tonight's soul of reason This is Soul of reason a program that will examine the roots of the black box

Speaker 2 00:00:43.670
Soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University

Speaker 1 00:01:04.580
With us this evening on soul of reason is Stephen Goodwin who's an investment counselor Options Specialist and one of the few blacks who on Wall Street

Speaker 3 00:01:13.010
And Steve as we talk about the market today those of us in the black community certainly concerned about it as it relates to New York City and it relates to what's happening throughout the world What really is the status of the stock market today I'll ask you a little later on Is it a good thing for blacks to get into But let's talk about just the status of the stock market itself What is it today

Speaker 4 00:01:34.190
Well the actual status of the stock market on a day to day basis is more or less contingent upon refit and to financial developments in Washington D.C. and New York City every now and then we hear words such as Arthur Burns besides that who's the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board that he's going to be a little more flexible it has added to his thinking we'll be gone to a flat to a loan guaranteed in New York City

Speaker 5 00:02:06.280
Any event there is some deterioration in the municipal and corporate bond markets which is on a day to day basis very bullish news for the stock market

Speaker 3 00:02:16.900
Now remember we were talking a layoff and use the term bullish Now I know that means a lot down on Wall Street but it means something else in the black community sometimes What are you talking about when I speak in terms of a bull and bear which the stock market symbols of bull market means the market is going up at a bear market means the market is going south Is going down and we're not doing so well And what you're suggesting is that as the union particularly in New York City fiscal situation moves from one level to another every day that the chairman of Federal Reserve Board Arthur Burns and other government economists make certain suggestions as to what they think might happen This is very complicated and I know that a number of people don't really understand the main thing is being proposed as a kind of federal loan guarantee And some people both in the city and certainly in the Midwest and other places particularly like New York say that this is giving money to New York Could you explain a little bit what really is intended there and what the impact of this might be on the stock market

Speaker 5 00:03:31.390
Well I'm not actually sure how individuals in the Midwest feel that a federal loan guarantees in New York City in effect is giving money to New York whereas a couple of years ago the federal government provided a loan guarantee to Lockheed and on a continuous basis our foreign affairs policy is simply subsidizing undeveloped and developed foreign countries who have certain political interests which may be Democratic Democratic let's say so This is something that the federal government has been doing domestically and internationally for some period of time and I see no reason why it can't direct its energies to providing a federal loan guarantee to New York City

Speaker 3 00:04:17.500
Now the loan guarantee as I understand it means that behind each bond so is a guarantee even the federal government that is a particular municipality can't pay it off the federal government will pay it off so it doesn't mean upfront money from the government but it does mean the possibility that the government might have to spend this money And by having this federal loan guarantee it's my understanding at least that this should make the bonds more attractive to investors They feel that they have less a chance of losing their money they not have any chance of losing their money And as a result of this the bonds then would become taxable rather than non-taxable which they are now All right That's correct So that that's one thing it's into the market now in general Would you say that we are in a recession maybe even a depression How do you folks on Wall Street look at that and particularly being a black on Wall Street you know just how bad things are in the black community 15 and 20 percent unemployment and the commitment to civil rights and movement of blacks forward falling apart So now when you look at the economy where it looks like the institution of last in first out is hitting black people How do you look at the economy both as a as a black person and as a market specialist right from the vantage of a market specialist in the intermediate sense that is six months to one year

Speaker 5 00:05:48.460
The market appears in the market Well the economy appears to be in an up cycle We've noticed increases in both the corporate and individual incomes We've noticed increases in production and employment We've noticed a certain moderation in the inflation rate because of a reduction in food prices Soybeans corn meal etc. We've noticed a reduction also in short and long term money market instruments which are very very positive signs that I guess from the end of August until now put the economy back on a very broad and solid recovery paste How fast recovery will last and how extensive it will be is questionable because there is a general thinking that if New York does to fall to a certain extent it may either abort the U.S. recovery to an extent That extent is really not known But that's probably only monkey wrench in the whole thing at this point

Speaker 3 00:06:59.790
Well again looking at the market why does it appear that the market has really gone down Why did it go down in the first place I understand someone has to with the oil crisis and then why is it turning back up Because oil gasoline is still very very expensive

Speaker 6 00:07:21.750
Two things here the market really hasn't reacted negatively toward the news of a possible default on a part of the city And if you recall basically when we had the oil embargo around October 3rd the Dow Jones industrial average was at the close to the 1000 level right Well it wasn't till around December 1973 where it finally dropped 200 points and then began to move again Now the point I'm making here is that in the interim the Middle East countries made it clear that they would increase oil prices by 20 percent and have a 5 percent cutback in production Nonetheless this to a large extent and the most significant extent to the U.S. economy into a recession Now according to the latest statistics from the Council of Economic Advisors they feel that in view of what is happening and that is the financial crisis of New York City that we might have an increase in interest rates that there may be a reduction in municipal spending and to a certain extent it may be some possible crowding out even in bull markets for other municipalities who have ratings not as good as New York cities but the overall consensus is that this will remove 1 percent from the gross national product Now I bring this up only to point out two things that in certain instances the market may misjudge a crisis and we could be seeing the same thing here with a possible possibility looming over us now of a default or our non default where the market could misjudge it very similar to the way it misjudged the oil crisis But at the current current time that is on a day to day basis there is no deterioration in the market either in the corporate markets in this bull markets all the equity markets as news to me the Washington or from New York State comes out with regard to Financial assistance to New York City

Speaker 7 00:09:34.170
But to translate this into terms that are meaningful to the everyday person in the black community and the white community who is out of a job You said the market is turning up and it's about eight forty eight 60 or whatever happens to be at a given day And you say things are looking better yet there's still 15 to 18 percent unemployment in the black community now not that you guys on Wall Street are totally responsible for it but there is some responsibility because of the way in which corporations tend to spend and invest their money What really does this mean This mean and in six months unemployment rate is going to drop or does that mean that the basic federal policy which is a tight money policy built around a 7 percent unemployment is going to keep us going along at a very slow pace And of course if it's 7 percent for the country at large it's 14 percent is double that for the black community So what about that

Speaker 4 00:10:30.840
Well I think the overall unemployment rate has been moving down over the last six months from its near double digit area We saw the latest figures that were released for the month of August I think put unemployment at eight point six percent vs. eight point three percent

Speaker 6 00:10:52.590
We saw in the previous month which simply means that something like I think an additional I think it brings the total unemployment around 8 million people who are unemployed What segment that is black and white I really don't know But I think that the basic trend here in the labor market is toward a lower unemployment rate because as the economy begins to move out of a recession a lot of industries are not even operating at near capacity And there have been increases in production so as companies begin to gear up their sales and increase their production they begin to hire more and more people And the point I'm making here is that as we move out of recovery and the faster we move out and the more broad based economic recovery is and individual firms whether they be textiles consumers autos whatever particular industry in the economy begin to benefit from this upward move and there are increases in capacity utilization and sales move up and production level step up in the sales then you have a subsequent increase in the level of employment in these particular places and this is the benefit

Speaker 1 00:12:03.630
How long does this take though What's it's like I'm six to nine months right

Speaker 7 00:12:07.430
So if this continues this means that somewhere around the summer we can expect to see the unemployment rate dipping even more Right But again and I know this is not necessarily a specialty but as a black person who's involved in the market I'm sure you're concerned about it Again this raises the question about the viability of the American economic system particularly as it relates to blacks because I say blacks a last in first out first to feel the effects of these ripples these minor recessions these ripples and then of course these great depressions And how do how do you see it as a black person who's involved in the market and how do you think the market sees it Or do they really care Because we recognize that basically the market is 99 percent white And basically these are the people who control our society So that is the way you see it as persons may differ from the way in which the market sees it All right from a point of view of a black person who's viewing the stock market or viewing the general economic recovery as it is I really don't have any encouraging news because

Speaker 4 00:13:18.240
Well let me let me step back If I were a black professional say in the coming out of law school today I think I would focus a great deal of my attention to baby becoming a legal expert and municipal bonds and going down to Wall Street and seeking employment and a woman and a municipal bond house where I would specialize in analyzing the municipal ratings of various spouses across the country Now as a blind person who may be non-professional or semi-skilled I really wouldn't know where to tell you where to go or what to do

Speaker 7 00:13:55.180
But I would say I would actually go to those particular industries in the economy where there seem to be the greatest increase in production for example now when you say that young blacks might want to look into areas like production and legal analysis of municipal bonds what you're really saying is that the economy is changing and the black population better be moving along with these changes but this does raise a question about the fact and maybe this gets back to feel an empathy with education that so many blacks do not have the technical skills or educational backgrounds to move into these areas which still puts it back to the economy How did the societies more than just the economy is what what does the future hold What are the next 25 30 years hope for blacks The economy is in trouble now Maybe you will disagree with me The economy is in trouble but to many of us it appears that the economy is in trouble When you carry even a 7 percent unemployment rate So how do you see this Because this is very important is important to people like yourself in the black community who are involved in the financial community as well articulate our concerns to some of the people who really run our country The people have money

Speaker 4 00:15:09.220
Well first of all I am firmly of the opinion whether you're a skilled or unskilled or professional or semi-professional You can do anything you want to do I happen to think in the financial community where there is tremendous change more frequently than in any other industry There are more opportunities emerging all the time For example with the possibility of default on a part of New York City for the first time we're beginning to see NYSE member firms and municipal bond firms bound to specialize in the purchase and sale of municipal bonds

Speaker 8 00:15:47.710
Developing a research department in municipal bonds Now we we haven't had this on the street for years and these are simply people who will just go out and make sure that the the ratings are solid and that certain data available on a given municipality is available and it is accurate and it is up to date Now anyone who can read or write or has a desire to get into this I would just simply say you just don't get into it For example I'm looking at something myself We're on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange they're just beginning to trade what they call Jenny made which are government National Mortgage Backed certificates Now this has been the first time we've ever had a futures market and what we call Jenny Mace Now I've dealt in futures before but this whole area and Jenny maze is gonna be a new one So I got on a plane and I went out there and I just simply checked it out and I did that on my own to see whether there really was money to be made in the trading of Jenny major and if so how But the point I'm making is that in the financial community because it fluctuates more in terms of changes in the economy they're more organizational and structural changes more frequently in this area than there are other industries

Speaker 9 00:17:09.220
Now the industries that are benefiting from an increased or benefiting from the I guess the economic recovery more so than in other industries for example the autos beginning to look a lot more positive in seventh first half of 76 than they did in 75

Speaker 8 00:17:29.620
Well I would simply say that if I had any expertise in dealing with people on any level I would probably go to the auto industry and seek employment there before I would go to the forest industry are the leisure group industry I'm saying this is the way I would be thinking about coming out of school B of ours out of school and out of a job right now I'll see if I was in a job I'm currently unhappy and I wanted to increase my income prospects and my upside ability to get ahead This is where I would go

Speaker 1 00:18:02.430
I'll get on the night

Speaker 7 00:18:03.460
So the reason is Stephen Goodwin who is an investment counselor and options specialist with United States option in the national and when we're talking about the effects of changes in the stock market and the economy of the nation on the black immunity And speaking of the stock market of course the whole purpose of stock market is to buy and change exchange stocks and bonds for profit both profit for the investor and profit for the salesmen on the street Possibly Steve you could tell our audience first the what Awesome good investment possibilities Well people in the black community And then secondly you can more or less discuss you know how a person who works on the street on Wall Street such as yourself operates What kind of skills and necessary How do you make your money etc. But let's talk about first the opportunities for investment in the stock markets And I would have to say safe investment for those of us in the black community because it is not a large amount of accumulated affluence in the black community which we can afford to lose

Speaker 4 00:19:07.410
Well in terms of answering your first question what are Bible investments for blacks I'm of the opinion that blacks do have sufficient capital by which they can actually afford to take certain risk really to stay out of a stock market B Any black person who has sufficient capital is able to put it in savings banks and savings and loan associations may think a little bit more carefully about putting its investments in maybe municipal bonds or government securities which are for a higher yield than savings and savings loan associations

Speaker 9 00:19:49.560
However those blacks who don't have high risk capital I would certainly encourage you stay out of the stock market or out of any other fast moving money markets

Speaker 6 00:20:00.390
Nonetheless those blacks who have been for a long time now putting money in the nation's savings and savings and loans might seek better returns with the same degree of safety on their principle by looking in the short term money market obligations or long term obligations

Speaker 7 00:20:16.390
Now is the option market one of those short term money situations if you're talking about the option market is a very fast market and it's highly leveraged market

Speaker 9 00:20:29.940
You couldn't make a lot of money and you can lose a lot of money

Speaker 7 00:20:34.320
I think that's the key point and that relates to your other point about caution Your market involves the possibility of winning making money the possibility of losing And of course one of the things that people like you want to do is to maximize the possibility of making money and minimize the possibility of losing it And if you talk about this option money which is a very fast type of turnover in terms of the time of the operation you're suggesting that it is both one where one can gain a lot and under the wrong circumstances passing where one could lose a lot

Speaker 4 00:21:08.620
You make it very simple and playing the option game because it's a highly leveraged game and it will be referred to as capital leverage We're talking about situations where an individual may put up one dollar but the prospect of making four dollars or before month time period and if he's dead wrong perhaps you still get us one dollar back whereas if you went to OTB he put up one dollar in less tax less time it takes say in the name of the horse was asked if he lost one dollar

Speaker 8 00:21:42.710
But then again you might make seven or eight dollars and it's the same correlation with numbers You know people who put up one dollar may have the upside shot of making ten dollars and in any event they're wrong lose the entire one dollar So options is somewhere in the middle of OTB and actually the numbers at least you get another shot at getting your one dollar back even though you didn't make before technically specifically what is an option market

Speaker 9 00:22:09.990
How does it work An option is the right to buy an underlying security over given period of time at a stated price i.e. a 50 dollar stock maybe may have a 48 hour option that is to say over the next three months if you were to give me forty dollars you'll be able to buy the stock at at forty dollars And even though the stock is selling at 50 right now In the event you do not exercise that option that is you do not decide to convert the option into the purchase of the underlying stock You lose your entire 40 dollars That is an option and that how and that is how an option relates to a stock So the point here in terms of capital leverage if you've got a ten dollar stock what a five dollar option over the next four months we're saying if the stock goes up one point to eleven That's a 10 percent move on the part of the stock If the option goes up one point from five to six that it's a 20 percent move on the part of the option So you can see given the same numerical move on the upside or the downside on the stock the percentage change or the option is much greater So given very volatile stocks which I will not name there is tremendous leverage here and you can make a lot of money

Speaker 7 00:23:39.960
And the way you make the money is to sell the option to someone else Is that the way it works

Speaker 9 00:23:44.610
We either hold it and sell it It's a very liquid market for options out of Chicago

Speaker 7 00:23:50.910
I see that's one short way of making money in the market What's another short term approach to making money on the market and then you can tell the audience about the long term approach

Speaker 9 00:24:01.920
Well there are a lot of various options strategies that one can put together to molest maximizes return on a given amount of money Hey I just gave you a situation where a person would go out and body underlying option on the assumption that the stock was going up Maybe you can do various kinds of bullish spreads bearish spreads butterfly spreads a whole variety of things

Speaker 3 00:24:29.230
And that's the technical terminology which means that you do certain things in terms of buying one kind of stock and selling right

Speaker 9 00:24:36.450
Right For example a bullish spread in a given option You may buy January 35 and sell it January 40 Now January 35 January 40 what does that mean Right January Well first of all a 35 was the strike price That's the price at which you could buy the stock January is the expiration period that's when the options expire So if I buy a January 35 and I sell in January 40 I'm saying the most I can make is five points Now for this privilege of making five points What about to put up in some cases and maybe a dollar maybe two dollars But the whole point is between now and the end of January I've locked in my upside profit

Speaker 8 00:25:22.650
I know exactly where I could break even then I know exactly how much I can lose this is what we call a a bullish money spread in options But there are a whole there's so many strategies to simply really boggles the imagination

Speaker 10 00:25:36.390
Of course this points out why it's important that they are people like you who identify with the black community who are in the market and maybe the second part of the question would it be of interest to our audience And that is how does a person like you make your money Because I don't know whether you invest in the market but I do know that a number of people who actually are involved in selling do not necessarily make their money from investment

Speaker 11 00:26:01.430
So how do what profit is this whole process to you

Speaker 4 00:26:06.240
Well before I actually came to Wall Street I made a great deal of money in the market I bought a given stock It was in the high technology area at 65 and it went to 96 and I got out of 86 and I had borrowed about four grand at Cornell or had some other money and I had made about eight nine and gave back Cornell Emory

Speaker 9 00:26:28.470
So over an eight month period I had made about four or five thousand thousand dollars and I bought a fancy sports car that was the beginning of the end and it will I really sit around and I actually conjure up ideas predicated on prosperity or calamity or just the national economic trends For example I know you all recall when a certain airline

Speaker 6 00:27:01.410
Was being considered for takeover by the Shah of Iran or a possible merger with another domestic airline here in the U.S. or even the possibility of being subsidized by the government Well the question that emerged to my mind is what kind of financial deal can a person put together where whether the airline was taken over by the Shah subsidized by the U.S. government or merged with another airline money could be made So I sit around and think of things like that

Speaker 7 00:27:31.320
And of course whenever you handle a transaction for a customer you and your company get a brokerage fee or a transactional right which also helps to make it possible for you to make some profit of the market In summary as we come to the close about program what is your opinion about black people going into the stock market as investment counselors

Speaker 9 00:27:55.650
Great Eureka Now why is that What is the reason for saying that Well it's it's an industry which over the last four years I've seen so many blacks wiped out I like somebody Somebody come back

Speaker 10 00:28:08.440
Okay Well that's I think that's a good point in which to close our program tonight Our guest on tonight's Night soul of reason has been Stephen Goodman who was an investment counsellor and option specialist with United States option International And we've been talking about the impact on the changes in the financial conditions of the country And Wall Street on the black community
