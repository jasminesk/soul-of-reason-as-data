Jack Johnson Joe Lewis Satchel Paige Josh Gibson Ralph Metcalf Jesse Owens Arthur Ashe What do these men have in common They have all helped to make sports a major part of black life in America Here Allen Baron publisher of Black sports magazine discussed the meaning of sports to the black community On Tonight soul of reason This is Soul of reason a program that will examine the roots of the black box

Speaker 2 00:00:51.270
Soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University

Speaker 1 00:01:12.210
With us this evening on soul of reason is Alan Barron who is publisher of Black sports magazine a magazine which focuses on the role of blacks in American and world sport And as we said on the tease Alan sports are such a major part of the black experience I was wondering as a publisher and as a writer about black sports if you can give our audience some idea as to why you think sports is such an important part of the black experience

Speaker 3 00:01:40.560
Well I think that it is basically a cultural experience Blacks have traditionally utilized sports as the thin entering wedge to break into the major subset of the system And I think that we could talk just a few short minutes about antebellum slavery days when blacks were pitted against one another in a boxing format in what they called the circle square and that's the ring that was drawn in the dirt on the plantation and rich slave owners would take and pit their big slave against their fellow slave owners big slave and it got to be a way of life for the slave because the guy who could fight best he was not allowed to work into the field He was brought up to be a sort of a yard nigger He worked around the around the yard taking care of the horses as opposed to being out there in the sun because he got to be a favorite pastime And when I think Billy what I believe happened is that The black soon learned that there was a means to an end through this facility of sports and that thing moved from boxing to horse racing where traditionally all of the jockeys who won the first big races were blacks men of men of means never sat the back of a horse I mean that was just something you didn't do you owned horses it was a pastime but you never climbed up on the back and rode that thing down toward the finish line You had your lives to do it initially and then later on when blacks were free

Speaker 4 00:03:05.740
If freedom in the south was freedom they were actually hired And as we know that probably the most famous black job jockey is the legendary Isaac Murphy absolutely rode more Kentucky Derby winners and anybody who's ever ridden I believe But I think your point is well taken about how the roots of sport in America and particularly go into black life right from slavery Right from the plantation particularly boxing and horse racing and then as we've moved into the more modern sports every sport that blacks have touched they have managed to gain ascendancy And I think it refers to baseball and refers to first firstly it refers to track and field with the great black sprinters to the point where they were looking for the White hope to beat men like Ralph Metcalf and Jesse Owens and then it moved into baseball as moved into basketball and now moving into football and with the ascendancy of Arthur Ashe and the fact that after the Ashes fantastic victory at Wimbledon you're going to find black youth all over the country picking up tennis rackets in my opinion there's no doubt that blacks will be in the forefront of American tennis players

Speaker 3 00:04:22.830
Well I think that you know when you take a look at people who are trying to bridge an economic gap and when you have some physical ability and it doesn't require anything above physical ability just some dedication of time and energy which every one of us has you suddenly see how blacks can come to or minorities can come to preeminence in the sport for basketball greatness you need a basketball and a hoop and you really don't need 96 feet of solid wood floor with lines like you need a broken down courtyard like you find around most of the inner city in urban areas across the country because one of the things that I write about and speak about is the fact that in some ways I feel that sports are overemphasized particularly in the black schools in that sense is a myth that sports represent a pattern of economic mobility for most people

Speaker 5 00:05:12.240
The few people who get the million dollar contracts the few Moses Malone and the few Kareem Abdul Jabbar is and so on are really one thousands of one percent And then when you multiply that literally hundreds of thousands of black youth are spending dozens and dozens and dozens of hours a week on basketball courts and track and field fields and things of this type you wonder what this is doing in terms of the black youth of America

Speaker 4 00:05:44.620
Since we need so many people who might be accountants and scientists and politicians and teachers and so on I think that I know in black sport you've written about this but what are some of your thoughts on it today

Speaker 3 00:05:56.420
Or Roscoe you and I will never different that opinion because that's the reason black sports came into existence because we believe that sports is out of control in our society and even getting more so specifically in our community because we have kids who all they want to do is learn the bounds of basketball and I'm interested in reading and they don't know the fact that sports careers are very short term The average life expectancy in terms of careers in the NFL is examples three years In basketball it's something like six years So you're taking a terrible risk when you totally centralize all of your living experience and by trying to be a professional athlete in addition to the fact that as an example there thirty five hundred colleges and universities in America and at least half of them field ten men on the basketball team So you've got a tremendous odds against you when you think that they're only 17 teams in the NBA drafting about three guys each every season So your ability to make it as a professional is very miniscule at best We believe that sports like any other thing is a healthy adjunct to life

Speaker 6 00:07:01.150
We also believe that in a lot of cases it can be a stepping stone to other things as a result of that philosophy We do a thing called the man and one called TCB an anachronism for taking care of business in our magazine when we talk about great black athletes who have used their facility for physical this to become the head of some program to pursue their doctoral degrees to really immerse themselves in American system as opposed to just trying to be an entertainer for the system in itself

Speaker 1 00:07:30.700
I think that's quite significant as matter of fact as you're talking about your magazine black sports which we'll talk about later more detail I was thinking that for black youth to read it's important that they read things that are of interest to them Sports are of interest to them So not only are you serving a function in terms of helping to teach him about the world of sports you're also helping teach him to read because the magazine is well written and it does cover a whole range of topics And I've noticed and more recent issues you've gotten into things like gymnastics and lacrosse things that blacks generally have not been particularly well known for although occasionally we have had champions in those various areas So in that sense I think your magazine does form a particular function on the other hand I'm sure you've had people ask you why do you really need a magazine and black sports since whenever you picked up sport magazine Sports Illustrated Newsweek Time and you name it If there is a sports cover it's going to be at least 50 50 a black person and there's a tremendous discussion about sports so why don't you tell our audience both why you conceptualize the magazine black sports and why you think there's a need for it and finally how successful has it been

Speaker 6 00:08:53.440
Well I'd like to answer me a little bit in reverse I'm sure you were absolutely successful We feel really encouraged by the fact that on a monthly basis we are now selling three hundred thousand single copies which makes us a good sized magazine in terms of the American marketplace But the whole concept of this magazine and the reasons for it are very obvious here in nineteen seventy five We are probably one of 10 monthly publications going to an audience of approximate twenty three and maybe 30 million people You talk about the black I'm not the black community talking about magazines like Ebony and Essence and on core and Black Enterprise correct this type and you fall into that particular grouping as you say of magazine as they are called specialty magazines a specialty audience magazines when you talk about the black male and his need to identify and to know who he is and what he is We're just the only magazine that's out there There's a very definite psychological truism that I'm sure you're you're completely aware of that is that you are what you perceive yourself to be now for black men We ain't nothing because we've never been able to perceive ourselves in terms of the written word in terms of magazine projections There's just never been this kind of an image you know for black Americans So the black sports magazines purpose is not only to inform people entertain them but it's to present a kind of image of black America that's never been seen So why there's a proliferation of white views of sports Our contention is out white America has always created our heroes and it's time for us to create our own heroes not the black sports wants to do that but we want to present you with some behind the scenes kinds of data a different perspective When I talk with Chamberlain as an example it's on a very low key kind of a basis where he is very real the language is a little bit different and he is not trying to say to me it was a great game W did this and I did that and as a team we won He may say many a sorry dude and I don't like playing with him don't quote me on this but whatever it may be and then we'll arrange the story so that he has a chance to really use black sports as a forum as a platform for his lifestyle for his concepts which other sports magazines don't give the black athlete they give him the sports page kinds of projection and I think our audience deserves more than that

Speaker 7 00:11:13.120
That is true about many sports magazines that they are more or less reportorial magazines rather than analytical magazines I find in reading black sports that your articles about unknown or lesser known athletes appeals to me far more than your articles about the ones I have read about and I think part of that is that it does provide an opportunity for me to empathize to understand the life space of the typical black athlete rather than just the superstar Also I find that in your specialty columns like the man and TCB it gives me an opportunity in a sense to test my opinions against the opinions of other people who are right out there in the world of sport So in that sense I think you've done certainly a service plus your high school athlete and your college athlete of the month digging down into those black high schools or sometimes quite high schools where black athletes are doing some outstanding things So I feel very very positive about that particular part of it I'd like you to mention a new magazine that you conceptualizing which also deals with black youth but not in the field of sports Could you tell us about that new magazine

Speaker 6 00:12:31.910
We're really really high on on a project that we've called Discovery magazine and we've used the term Discovery because of a twofold purpose One is that black college youth which is the orientation and the direct slant for this editorial package are discovering themselves and discovering the American system which we are hoping to really be involved with helping them do And the second is that advertisers are just beginning to discover the black American economy So that Discovery magazine is a very unique experience We call it a cultural experience for the black college student wherever he may be If he's on that white college campus he's in limbo If he's on that black college campuses in an unreal environment cause the world is in black the world is homogeneous mixture of all sorts of peoples And so what this magazine does is an Inter Collegiate communications facility We have data from Jackson State going to students who are at Michigan State and the vice versa students black students for the first time are having the ability to know what other black students are doing what problems they're facing where their heads are what their opinions are We've also made sure the book is a very light informative journal so that we're not trying to be a socio political book at all What we're trying to is entertain the heck out of these black college students while keeping their perspective on blackness at its zenith during these very critical years of their college education

Speaker 1 00:13:53.350
I think that's very important because humor is an important part of any struggle And as we know from the many black comedians and many black entertainers that humor has always been a part of our life It's been a part of our life in the world of sport as well which is the reason why many of the sports stories that we deal with stories that deal with the humor that comes out of the black experience I know that you've been very interested in the activities to honor black athletes Could you tell us about that very very briefly

Speaker 6 00:14:24.160
We we started the National Black Sports Hall of Fame About two years ago and we are currently involved with a building that is being constructed in Washington D.C. which will be the shrine to house all the artifacts to the great great black athletes in the past the present and the future

Speaker 1 00:14:41.860
We were talking this evening with Alan who's publisher of Black sports magazine And Alan I know in your travels through the world of sports particularly from the point of view of the black athlete You must have had some opportunity to observe how conditions have changed for black athletes even during the short four or five years during which you've published black sports magazine

Speaker 8 00:15:04.770
Oh absolutely I think that the change has been dramatic in terms of not only just the physical conditions that athletes are now enjoying but the particular kinds of status that they're also enjoying the largest heroes the greatest sports heroes in America today are the black athletes When you get off a plane in Des Moines Iowa and while Frazier is on a layover there and you see these thousands of young white kids as a corn crop belt or the wheat belt waiting to get a chance to glimpse the Great Wall Frazier you're beginning to understand the kinds of significance the sport has in our country And then again when you sit and talk as I had an opportunity to do with Mr. Robinson is Jackie Robinson just before his untimely death and you listen to the kinds of problems that he endured as he was trying to become the first black to play in baseball and you look at the way the wall phrases and I don't use Walt's name as any kind of a special case but just using him as an example the kind of prestige and facilities that today's black athlete has The change has been absolutely dramatic sense and since that time period Well the thing that I was concerned about as I asked the question

Speaker 9 00:16:18.930
Was whether the social conditions that black athletes face have changed There has been and I would say still is a considerable amount of discrimination not so much of an overt nature but of a subtle nature things like the 10 blacks room with whites on teams things like Can I assume positions of leadership on teams can they assume positions of leadership and unions can they be captains of teams This is the type of thing you're talking about because certainly the more overt things such as Jackie was talking about in terms of discrimination in hotels things of that type has diminished or almost completely evaporated except in certain parts of the South But I was referring Pressly to the social conditions that black athletes have to face And as a publisher and as one who knows a number of black athletes I think you could probably put a pretty good thing on that polls

Speaker 8 00:17:21.480
Let me just say one thing I understand your question love it more clearly Let me say that the first is a misnomer that most of us labor on and that is a sports is a cornucopia of life and that is some kind of utopian experience I think that what sports really is is a microcosm of the total system and because it is a microcosm we have the ability under a microscope a microscopic eye of the journalistic pen to really take a good close look at it So as an example racism in sports exists because there's racism in America drugs and sports exist because there's drugs in America And you now in light of that you're absolutely correct Roscoe the black athletes still suffers a tremendous amount of pressure in terms of social conditions Just take for example the fact that the outgoing commissioner of the NBA chose to designate as his successor a black man and the owners of the team chose not to accept him Now I mean that's a very unique situation when you talk about the bulk of the superstars in professional basketball today being black athletes and who can cope better with them I'd like to think than a guy who is a black who is an intelligent educated man who has already proven his his his worth of dealing with white American in a business vein but he can now deal with his superstar which is what that commissioner really has to deal with these kind of eccentric group of guys who make a million dollars and make all sorts of crazy demands I think that the microcosm of sports is reflecting a very deep seated problem that America has and that is that its racism goes far beyond what we used to think What I personally think was just an economic institution It goes really much deeper than that and somehow we are going to have to on a much greater scale not in my generation or your generation but with our children's children began to try and ferret out some of the regions and the realities that that exist about racism in America on solar reason we interview guests from a wide spectrum of fields we have psychologists and we have physicians and we have writers and poets and musicians educators sports figures etc.

Speaker 9 00:19:28.330
And one of the things that comes through is that in every facet of American life there is an extremely deeply embedded stream of racism that is unfair treatment characterized by the fact that people are black To me this is not a surprise although I think everyone subsequent to the kind of report possibly other than people like Kenneth Clark gonna murder all of the American dilemma maybe even people like Malcolm X We didn't realize the depth with which racism had penetrated the basic fabric of society On the other hand having been an athlete myself and having been on fields with a variety of types of athletes I must admit that I was not surprised at the way in which the white athletes have treated many black athletes and white owners and coaches treat them because it is this mentality that the black has a superior body and somehow or another he can do these things but he can't think too well And so as a black when you begin to think as you begin to take positions of leadership many whites in the past and I would say even today take a somewhat hostile position in this So when Jackie Robinson first went into baseball and he was a nice guy and he was quiet and he let people call him out and calling all kind of names he was a great person to many writers When Jackie finally allowed the real personality of Jackie to come through which was to call it where it was whether it was against a white or black or an umpire or a teammate or what have you It became troublesome He became cocky became someone who wasn't really the type of person you'd want to be a leader Yet when a white person a person like it is Nike for example became a baseball manager did the same thing He showed great sophistication and great leadership capacity characteristics so that I do believe you know possibly contrary to some of your feelings that racism is very deeply embedded in sports It's very deeply embedded in society and since sports a part of society that affects sports The thing that I'm interested in I think you've written about in the magazine some you write is written about is the extent to which certain things are happening to change this For example John Mackey led the football players strike some years ago a black man I think a black man has the basketball players association now we are beginning to see some breakthroughs on this We begun to see situations where Brooklyn basketball a white person such as Rick Barry can be a minority on a predominately black team and still rise to some type of recognition yet at the same time be aware of the fact that he is a minority So I think that there are some changes in that direction I don't think those changes move up into the executive suites I think that your description would the psychology and the presidency of the NBA as an example of this I think the absence of managers in big league baseball is certainly an example of this And we can carry this on so well I might ask you a direct question

Speaker 10 00:22:42.580
As a publisher of a black sports magazine What are you doing through your magazine to help change this particular situation Well we personally take the position that our magazine should speak out as strongly as is possible in favor of equal treatment for blacks But I would also want to counter that and say that I am not as concerned about on the field activities as I am concerned about something that I think is much larger That's off the field When in the world everyone looks at baseball and wants to throw all the stones What about football Football has the same stinking problem that baseball has and that's is overt racism there no head black football coaches and yet black football colleges are turning out ballplayers that come out of college and start in professional ranks And yet when I think about hiring a head football coach or general manager they never look for black anyplace So I'm not willing to just want to castigate any one sport I want to say that I see a tremendous opportunity here the the militancy that blacks assumed and I don't ever think that the black can be militant He's always just demanding what the rest of the nation sort of gets But the militancy that the black society assumed several years ago has carried over into sports and that same leadership qualities same swaggering kind of braggadocio character who was walking around in the street saying I don't give a damn about what white folks think when it's when the streets were burning in 66 He's now an athlete John Carlos to Tommie Smith the kind of guys are saying to white established sports people that you've got to act right And we as a magazine feel that we should be a forum for that kind of intelligent presentation of values and changes We are working right now with Wally Jones and the concerned black athletes organization while he is I think a classic case his image was maligned his character was slandered they said he was transporting dope back and forth between teams and he has conclusive evidence that he was not and he has a tremendous lawsuit against the Milwaukee Bucks and the NBA We're giving Wally a platform and we're working with him because we believe that the guy is a model guy I mean he has really been an outstanding young black man in terms of working with youth gangs in Philadelphia and in the Virginia area So that black sports magazine takes a very strong position about Tom Paine and the reason that Tom Paine is in prison down in Atlanta Georgia and has never even been on the street on bail a guy where eight hundred thousand dollars in his pocket and is accused of raping 44 and 46 year old white women and is doing 15 years and has six more charges against him why no one's even raised the question the Atlanta Hawks don't want to discuss the problem So we feel that the changes that we recognize that you're actually correct there aren't changes that are being manifest but we think that there are much larger problems that no other media will even touch and that we as a magazine must begin to take issue with and to raise intelligent questions so that our readers want to say you know whereas the answer is not that we're given the answer but we're given the facts so that people can draw their own opinions What about the reaction of some people that say that as your major sports become predominantly black

Speaker 7 00:25:45.550
That they'll become less popular that the gay two seats will fall off that they'll just go back into the dark ages literally and figuratively What about that What's your position on that Have you written about that Have you had some articles done on that Because I think as basketball moves upwards of 80 percent and baseball moves up with a 50 percent football likewise that a number of people have severe racist connotations or feelings will continue to say that we've got to shut the door because they'll take over those people make America go round every day

Speaker 10 00:26:21.000
And I think that we did an article that really expressed our feelings and that we we the same call Rick Barry House hunky because we proved and the San Francisco warriors have proved a team with courage and conviction and had a black coach they had 10 out of 12 ballplayers were black the team captain was white and those guys had as much cohesion as they had to go out and play sandlot basketball and win the NBA championship I think that's indicative of the kinds of things that can happen if things are approached intelligently Now that isn't going to happen they used to say if you put a black at the quarterback spot you couldn't win Pittsburgh got really asinine this year they had a black quarterback out there Joe Gilliam who was winning games 1 won the entire pre-season won the first seven games this season They ran a poll in the pressing which quarterback do you want in the White populace to fill it up Pittsburgh said we want one that Bradshaw and they put him back at the helm of the ship There was no other reason than racism there is xenophobia there fear of the unknown They didn't know how their constituency was going to react and so they reacted in traditional white racist attitude It's a lot of hogwash to be very blunt about it If the team is winning if the team is doing the kind of things that the the constituency of the team once did on come out to see the ballplayers The New York Knicks I think are a classic example Blacks comprise the audience in the garden of nineteen thousand maybe 10 percent Roscoe Maybe 10 percent with the high price of the ducats And yet when Walt Frazier or Monroe falls to the floor 19000 fans swoon and it's not because they're all black or they're all they against black

Speaker 1 00:27:58.620
I think that's a good point and I think in that little discussion you've shown why it's important that a man like Allen Barron head a magazine like black sports I think also you've helped us to see the real importance of having a magazine dealing with the black athlete and his role in sports published by a black person I'd like to thank you Allen Baron publisher of Black sports magazine for being a guest on sole reason and to wish you good luck with your new magazine discovery which is going to deal with a black college student Thanks again very much
