Part Two sounder is the sequel to sounder the award women film about a black family in Louisiana Here land at the herring public relations specialists discuss the problems of promoting black films on tonight soul of reason This is Soul of reason

Speaker 2 00:00:37.940
A program that will examine the roots of the black box soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University

Speaker 1 00:01:02.360
With us this evening on soul of reason is Linda Herring who is in charge of public relations for the film part two sounder which is the sequel to the award winning sound

Speaker 3 00:01:12.470
And we're glad to have you with us tonight right to be here One of the things that we're gonna talk about tonight is the problem of promoting what we might call serious meaningful black films Films like Leadbelly films like The River Niger and films like Part 2 sounded and we've seen right in New York that we've had difficulty mobilizing a significant enough audience to keep the film moving We hope to get it back sometime soon But this is the type of problem that we face now to just begin top of the show Could you indicate why Bob redness who was the producer decided to do Part 2 sound and what the real difference is between this film and the original sound

Speaker 4 00:01:58.880
I think Bob's whole idea was to to expound upon the whole idea of the family that took the area and I think that his whole thought was not to continue in the same vein but to utilize a different idea And as you remember in the film it did show that we were talking more of about the problems of building the school as opposed to sound itself

Speaker 3 00:02:27.960
Yeah that's one of the criticisms that the critics made it sound like somebody who passed through and that became the name and I know Bob sadness as well and I know that he said yes the reason why he used that name is that this is something the public could identify with and frequently we find sequels of all type of Godfather 2 and this is entertainment too and all that kind of thing which has to do with the need I guess of the film industry to keep producing things that the public will identify with But in changing story the story really focuses on the father the family Nathan Lee working with his neighbors to build a school in this backwoods part of Louisiana against tremendous financial lives and against the opposition of the white landholders and the like which to those of us who've been to the struggle for black education is a very significant type of experience not to do you want to relive it but it wasn't significant Apparently this has not really caught on with the audiences And of course this bigger at least in New York I understand the film is doing fairly well in other places But this is the type of problem that you have in promoting what we might call serious black films as against the blaxploitation films which deal with violence and gore and you know racy language and sex and things like that So how do you you seize this part to sound in the context of that problem

Speaker 4 00:04:00.980
Well basically it's like anything else When you have a multitude of things going on especially the movies that you're mentioning it's kind of hard to come out and to say listen we have a very serious film I think that one of the the ideas that we have used and with part to song was to to do as we've done in New York to to get raptor ball VIP black Americans around the country to host these things and that in itself has as had been pretty good

Speaker 5 00:04:33.610
Did you mean to host a private education and put out and they will begin to identify with the film say its good and spread the word by word of mouth to other people

Speaker 4 00:04:42.470
Exactly They've always been screening and you know just having the press there and a few people But I think this has worked very well throughout the country and hopefully the film will catch on as opposed to using the running of promotions and ads and that that thing

Speaker 5 00:05:02.060
Yeah although I notice that you have a fairly significant ad campaign or you did have one in New York area What effect does the critics response to a film have on audiences

Speaker 6 00:05:17.330
The original sound I got fair reviews on the first go round and on the second go round after it began to be a box office success

Speaker 7 00:05:23.780
Some of the same critics weren't so hot went back and reviewed it again and they came up with reasons why it was good Which is sort of a self-fulfilling prophecy But the second film a sequel part you sound got reviews that said it's a nice film but it's overly sentimental It isn't dramatic and it's nice that these little black people at their school which is sort of a Naga is it puts a negative on it in terms of someone who really isn't no tooled up to see it because they want to see successful black people and maybe that's one of the problems that we have about dealing with the serious black films films that show black people striking out against the system black people standing up for what they believe and fighting for some of the things that we as black people need

Speaker 8 00:06:11.350
You know that's funny you'd mentioned that because and in the Bay Area for example a lot of the critics there even though they somewhat endorse the film felt that they want to see violence and it completely shocked me because it was complete against what Bob was talking about

Speaker 4 00:06:36.560
For example if your moment of film were when Nathan is saying to the landowner that I am having problems and then I'll make makes a remark to him I heard you're spending a lot of time on this of the school and you could see the smile that was supposed to say well the guy's gonna give you some money But then when he says Oh I hope you know what you're doing Well the reaction there

Speaker 9 00:07:02.520
You know that we as black folks we know when we see these thing but I think too many white critics they wanted to see it you know And as I the first thing with my mind was Richard Price statement at one of his albums about We know we've seen you make love in the movie you know that that thing And we've had to read these things into it Now here we go into a black situation whereby the white Critics are white people are saying they wanted to see it as a point of reading into it

Speaker 6 00:07:32.600
So I understand you it's part of the subtlety of the black experience as a whole Of course some critics will say that oppression and resistance to oppression is universal and they are universal statements that films can and should make in a sense

Speaker 7 00:07:51.440
I feel that some films that deal with social messages are seen to be great after the fact that after people come to see them and after they begin to say this is a great film it's a good film whatever reason then you can go back and look at the films that yeah that was there and that is a problem that I see Of because the other thing is that many of the young people many young black people particularly have been hooked on this violence racing cars racing women and racy language and without the role models the people that you're trying to involve and helping to carry the message It doesn't work And one question might be is when we invite black VIP to a screening even though we're inviting people who have status and name in the black community maybe those aren't the people that black people the everyday black person on the street listens to which is a very interesting thing that even politicians have been talking about who does and this is not only for the black population but white population Well who does the man in the street really listen to

Speaker 8 00:08:59.930
Well basically right when I when I mentioned VIP I was only talking about the host Hopefully in most cases for example you Richard Hatcher in Chicago and one liner in the Bay Area but they did invite VIP taxi cab VIP whoever we were not trying to stay with the doctors and lawyer because you and I know that these people are the people who get invited things free These are people who say in their little circle So that is a problem and hopefully we won't get interrupted there

Speaker 6 00:09:34.210
You know when you're in public relations you cover a lot of other promotions and campaigns and the like And public relations is a relatively new field for blacks There have been a few people who've been doing it for long years I can remember remember I name a billboard Jackson I used to work for That's the name

Speaker 7 00:09:53.600
Billboard When they used to have the big billboards who used to work for a standard oil when it was SL and he was one of the first blacks to get into this But now that the business community is recognize the massiveness of the of the black population in terms of the total dollar value they are putting more attention to it And as a result this suggests the need for more people who are specialized in working in the black community And as you do your work in public relations working on these various projects what do you find to be the most successful technique and getting any particular public relations message out to the black

Speaker 8 00:10:36.630
I find it odd that you don't change your your program programming your ads for example to go from say a New York Times that were there would be daily as opposed to an Amsterdam News that would be maybe a weekly My thing is that is that I try to use this this idea of keeping it before the public using the same type ads using the same type programming same type language talking but yet utilizing black newspapers black radio right on down the line

Speaker 7 00:11:12.930
That raises a question sometimes some of the ads that the major media producing now do have blacks in the ads but some of them still are lily white and I've turned to the Amsterdam News and more than one occasion and I've seen an ad that has only white characters in it in a very swanky upper upper middle class situation advertising some kind of car or liquor What have you and I really wonder Other than the fact it is a little lazy or cheap in terms of producing another ad as to why they would approach it in that way and in a sense you haven't said exactly the same thing would you say well let's use your mainstream ad now I can see a mainstream ad if it involves minority people in the ad but if the ad is totally mainstream How is that really going to be effective on Main Street

Speaker 9 00:12:03.050
I am truly for integrated ads Everything I do is integrated in terms of my my ad my reasoning for that is that I know as a as a black that when I pick up a newspaper I'll pick up anything and I see a black face that automatically tells me that I'm involved SS As and when I said total I'm talking about integrated ad that would go to both market and both

Speaker 6 00:12:28.750
Okay In other words you really are following the point that I was laughing and weren't talking about the old ads of use

Speaker 10 00:12:35.490
Well what about some other public relations techniques that can be used to reach the black community on any particular issue

Speaker 8 00:12:43.110
Well you I find you've got to go out there I mean you have to come to the word of mouth thing is probably more important than anything else And I think once you identify and once you recognize And that's my key That's the key word I feel a recognition of race that everybody must be recognize whoever they are And when you go out and really get involved or go to the area and include these type of promotions always to be successful

Speaker 5 00:13:15.180
Now in making the decision about the film sound Bob Radner who had produced the first film and produced part 2 sound sounder made a decision not to use Cicely Tyson and Paul Winfield and David Hooks and Kevin hooks I guess it was both of them What was the basis of that decision and why did he move away from a successful formula in terms of name actors etc. two actors who were very good at Exxon but were somewhat unknown What was the basis that was it strictly a financial situation or was it a question of necessity

Speaker 11 00:13:58.910
I think I think it was a real social thing as far as Bob is concerned

Speaker 8 00:14:06.030
He felt that you know you can use excessively in power when feel in Sidney Poitier You continue using but I think that his objective was that there are a lot of other black actors and actors Arar that should be used as you were saying the decision was made to bring in these new actors

Speaker 10 00:14:22.920
And it certainly does give an opportunity for black actors to get a chance to be seen and to be explored And with in a sense the paucity particularly of serious black films it does raise a question as to how do black people black actors get a chance to display their wares in films And I guess that's one reason why Bob Ratner decided to use Harold Sylvester and every right But do you think that's had any effect on the film Do you think that this might have had some effect on the drawing power of the film

Speaker 8 00:14:56.790
Definitely It's no question that when you have somebody like Cecily in power when if you were a successful bet that most people when they hear the sound name they first asked whether or not such is going to be it

Speaker 5 00:15:11.190
And you've been all over the country right

Speaker 12 00:15:12.680
Right You know I've heard it and I think that it's almost a sacrifice on Obama's part but I'm not plugging a new movie But you know he is using Paul when Winfield ancestry in another movie to be coming out in 77 and being found not about a hero enough but he said on the New York playwright Alice Childers this play right

Speaker 10 00:15:39.430
And it is true I wasn't trying to spot any one particular producer but it does raise a question about the industry There really is a paucity of serious dramatic roles for black actors and black actresses And when a serious one comes along generally the producers ask for Sicily or Paul James Earl Jones or Sidney or somebody like that who are very good excellent people But we have such a reservoir of great talent in our community that it really is too bad that they aren't more vehicles that can really display the talent And this goes back to something we were talking about early in the show and that is how can we promote more serious black films but how can we get black films that are on substantive topics partially historical for example has been no film about Frederick Douglass There's another great black man who recently passed away Paul ropes and it's been very limited amount about Paul Robeson there's something on television and we had the development of the archives that people are beginning to identify with But we we haven't had a serious film about Harriet Tubman or a serious film about Mary McLeod Bethune or even a serious film about the civil rights movement itself

Speaker 6 00:16:57.360
So there we have it We have to my very written five

Speaker 9 00:16:59.830
Plotz Yeah well I think the thinking here goes back to I think we you know as black folks who have financial capital if we can get into the business can learn about the business so that we can take that and invest money in these type thing

Speaker 13 00:17:17.589.9999999998836
And I'm I'm very happy that see an opportunity for him to to handle a total film to have the you know the hand totally that that means I'm learning a lot about what's going on and being able to get this out because at this point I'm finding that once a guy like Paul Robeson passed away you know you're gonna find somebody out there with some money will come and say it's a great idea and go and put them one up and do it And yet probably not even have really you told substance of what we're all about what we're talking about

Speaker 5 00:17:51.130
So I think it goes back to maybe a problem that we as blacks are going to have to salute and I had several people from the black entertainment film business on our show over the years most recently Cliff Frazier of federal media and we've been talking about the problems of packaging of black films or films about anything And it is a very expensive proposition it's a highly speculative proposition and it is one of the problems that blacks find in almost any area of business because what you're suggesting is that persistence and pressure is a good part of the game And it's certainly true Now you said you had an opportunity to participate in the promotion promotional part to sounded from top to bottom What does that entail What are some of the things that you did and what are some of the new things that you learned as a result of this experience

Speaker 13 00:18:43.090
Well I learned first of all that that the putting of the film is in segments I mean you start with I guess no one would be the idea of the screenplay Then you go from the actors or the participants and then you go into the actual production and then into promotion down the line And I think those segments are highly highly speculative highly competitive to the fact I know in San Francisco when Taj Mahal was not did not know when the film was gonna be put on the market and he was a you know he wrote the music for it but I had to sit and explain to him that basically the segments the duration you know you wrote the music you're finished with that we go to another phase of the line and I think he felt somewhat of a left out left out of the thing as opposed to being involved because that is one of the things that the creative activities like film and television much of your work is compartmentalized and whereas the public sees the person in front of the camera or behind a microphone and hears the person behind the microphone

Speaker 6 00:19:55.630
There are a lot of other things that go into it and sometimes even that person is in front of the camera doesn't really know all of the things that it took to get him or her there and all of the things that it takes to do the type of promotion that goes on Of course one of the things that you're saying now is that particularly in the black entertainment community we need to have better communication among ourselves Exactly We don't question it There are not a lot of us and therefore the informal network that develops in any particular profession needs to be even more effective among black performers producers actors and the like And I do think that some of that is emerging It is somewhat of a grapevine but beyond that we need to get into the whole question of influencing decisions about films For example were you able to significantly influence many decisions in part to sound Or was your role one of being involved but eventually the people put up the money make the decision

Speaker 8 00:21:00.770
I can safely say Dr. Brown that I was totally involved

Speaker 9 00:21:10.610
Let's say oh 40 percent involve in the total promotion of this film I think that there were some things that were done a little before I got there so I can't really But I can say that the advice the consultation that I gave the powers that be was accepted of course it's one of the problems that blacks face in many fields

Speaker 5 00:21:32.000
Politics helped in a political campaign that someone high above with power and money makes the decision and then some of us or blacks come in and ask to come in and try to make the best of that particular decision For example not necessarily with s sound a part too but in many black films suggestion is why isn't there more intensive promotion and showing right in the black community Why doesn't the film open in the black community in our cause The argument is that most people including black people go downtown to see movies and so on and that there are a lot of films shaft and Superfly and so on open downtown of a very successful But there is this feeling particularly among blacks who are more nationalistic in orientation that things that directly deal with our culture really should at least for the first week or two or what have you start in our community And of course in New York City as you well aware the large black communities not Harlem anymore A large black community in Brooklyn And so then we get into the fact that business and theaters basically have sort of left the neighborhood circumstance but there are still films Those theaters on Flatbush Avenue are still there others on 42nd Street There are still places where they could open But how do you respond to that Because I am not suggesting that you made the decision but it is a decision about promoting black films at a number of people raise

Speaker 9 00:23:02.360
Well certainly that in itself is a problem of locations Some of us say well if you opened there would the masses with the majority community go there I've always abandoned feeling that that whites if they want to see something they go to in fact they go not commit much when we go in there and so that argument I have to agree with you

Speaker 5 00:23:29.270
I think somehow we should make some changes because inferential you're also saying that in order for a film to really be successful it has to have a fairly significant white audience Exactly And that is because not black people don't patronize films But it does require a lot of dollars to reimburse the people who made and promoted the film I think I went there to figure it takes a couple of three million dollars to make the film and a couple of three million dollars to distribute the film which means you've got about six or seven million dollars to clear before you begin to make any money back And I also heard a figure that something like eight out of ten films don't really you know distributed by you major producers distributors don't really make money

Speaker 7 00:24:14.540
So they really depend on two or three maybe 30 percent to

Speaker 5 00:24:19.550
What do you say it made you maybe I let you know they don't make money so it's really a on this blockbuster to go through and of course when we talk about black films we really had very few blockbusters I guess the shaft and Superfly and sound have been really major blockbusters Zach river Niger which was a film and had tremendous impact in terms of black struggle has been somewhat successful over the head and certainly hasn't had people standing in lines around the corner to get there And then of course we've had these black boy station films like Mandingo and films of that type and have people twisted around the block three times to see a slave Now Alex Haley's film roots is going to be shown on ABC which is a new development you know that's the book right you know tracing Haley's background back to Africa And I will be very interested in that particular development You're going to be involved in that project

Speaker 9 00:25:20.780
I don't know yet you would hope so I do hope so It's gonna look like it's going to be a winner

Speaker 5 00:25:24.650
Yeah because that really is the type of project It looks like it's going to move along Well let's talk a little bit more about some of the problems that you as a business person has in organizing promoting developing a black business which in this instance happens to be public relations

Speaker 9 00:25:44.240
Well basically I think deep deep down I don't know You know I start my business in Cincinnati Ohio about nine years ago I mean a home of the Cincinnati Reds Right Right And I relocated to Los Angeles about a year and a half ago and I find that it's not so much a We have problems and money and problems of other things But I try to go into a situation totally business And yet with the idea that that I realize once I came in who I am I know don't try to depend solely say on the black community to at least run my business But yet in everything I'm involved that I try to include and I think that the other problem is that we have in many cases that we feel that even blacks and whites feel that maybe a black feel it's not good is having a say I won a majority today So that basically most of the problems

Speaker 10 00:26:48.980
That's a problem at practically every black person in every field phases And even now the feel of the nationalist revolution the black revolution whatever you want to call it has black awareness has caused many people black people in particular to recognize that blacks abilities are randomly distributed just like whites And given the same opportunities they can do as well and better and we have ample examples of that in sports and in medicine and entertainment and law and so on But nonetheless the prevailing feeling still is that the mountain is a little bit higher It's a lot higher to climb For blacks in a comparable situation with comparable abilities because of the pervasive racism that exists in our society what are some of the things that you've done personally to try to overcome that particular obstacle

Speaker 8 00:27:40.340
Well I think you know here again trying to be the best at what I do and to at least go in with the idea of not having any feelings that that might be against me because I am black I happen to be I happen to think that I'm a PR man who happens to be black but I'm good and I feel that we are in any field to be successful we have to do it better and we are better

Speaker 10 00:28:06.590
And that's my whole philosophy because that's the message we deliver I guess week after week on soul the reason that as black people analyze their problems and strive to deal with their problems that excellence has to be the byword and this excellence does help to overcome the racism that we all face And of course once you deliver your service and once people become aware of what you can do You've made it a guest on the night So the reason has been minute Herring was public relations specialist who's been working in the promotion of part to sound it
