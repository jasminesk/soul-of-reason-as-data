Speaker 1 00:00:01.380
On August 13th nineteen hundred and six 167 black soldiers of the 25th Infantry Division were dishonorably discharged without trial by President Theodore Roosevelt for their alleged participation in the now infamous Brownsville raid here Author French of the Negro Ensemble Company discussed the any CS presentation of the play based on this incident on tonight soul of reason This is Soul of reason

Speaker 2 00:00:50.500
A program that will examine the roots of the black box soul of reason is produced by the NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University

Speaker 1 00:01:15.080
With us this evening on soul of reason is author French who plays Corporal Boyd Conyers in the Negro ensembles company's presentation of the play The Brownsville raid which is written by Charles Fuller and author Or should I call you Corporal Conyers We're glad to have you with us tonight It's a pleasure to be here

Speaker 3 00:01:36.740
As we said at the beginning of the program this is an incident which occurred many many years ago some seventy one years ago now that a lot of people both in the white and black community don't know much about but at the time created quite a furor in the country particularly the black community because for the first time soldiers were cashiered were discharged were let out of the army losing all of their rights of being able to work as civil service workers to get pensions etc. because of an incident in Brownsville Texas where some people shot up the town it was alleged that they were black soldiers and then as the the story the Brownsville raid and the investigation goes on in the play Eventually these 167 men for companies Beasley indeed of the 25th Infantry Division were ceremoniously discharge by order of President Theodore Roosevelt which finally led as the challenges continued to the institution of what they call courts of inquiry before anyone can be discharged from the army now so that in retrospect there's been some justice And then finally in 1972 the Congress in 1973 I believe it is the Congress the United States did finally pardon all of these men

Speaker 4 00:03:05.030
Only problem is that all of the dead with one right

Speaker 3 00:03:08.420
So based on this you and some 10 or 12 other members of the Negro Ensemble Company have presented a very very beautiful play which is now showing at the theater Dili Christopher Street in the village now could you tell us why the NTC decided to present the Brownsville raid on the occasion of its 10th anniversary as a Black Repertory Company in New York City

Speaker 5 00:03:37.190
Well besides it being the 10th anniversary of any C it was also the two hundredth anniversary of American independence it was our bicentennial And so the thought was to do something historical and in keeping with the spirit of the Bicentennial and this historical incident even though very few people are aware of it was something that we thought would fulfill both the bicentennial and the purposes of the Negro Ensemble Company

Speaker 6 00:04:07.250
And I know that Doug Ward who plays Sergeant Mingo Sanders in the play and is also the artistic director of NBC does feel that very strongly that the plays of the company should reflect both the concerns of the black community at the same time say something to the nation as a whole about what really is happening and has happened in our country And Theodore Roosevelt was one of our heroes The success at San Juan Hill and Cuba and the Rough Riders and these are some of the same soldiers that helped to make with Colonel Theodore Roosevelt a great man or at least elect him president And then we find in this play he is negotiating behind the scenes with Booker T Washington who then was the recognized black leader at least by the white community to hold off his decision to capture these men of the Army and the most cynical part of it is that he held it off until the day after he got elected

Speaker 5 00:05:14.750
Theodore Roosevelt requested black troops and almost would not fight any of his battles at in Cuba San Juan Hill unless he got black troops He got into trouble strangely enough by inviting Booker T Washington to the White House and got a lot of bad What can I say Reverberations from it People didn't like it Southerners didn't like it So by the time this incident happened he was also in a strange position of now showing that he was not a nigger lover That he was really not for the blacks as much as that incident seemed to show us because he had a black man the White House was the first time that it happened So he took the other tack and became extremely strong and revengeful against the Brownsville soldiers And if the whole story is known he went to all kinds of lengths to prove these men guilty even after they were out He had hired detectives and people to try to get or even to state that they had confessed The men who were already out None of this really worked But he went through great lengths to prove that this was a just decision because of course it was not

Speaker 3 00:06:35.750
Now do you get the historical facts straight Right It is true I believe that in Brownsville Texas which is a very hot town southern Texas and also very prejudiced town at least at that time they black troops who were with the 25th Infantry were at a fort rather hit town And the economy of the town was a little shaken up by the fact that some whites didn't want to shop where blacks were even though they were soldiers and they fought in the various wars and won medals And somehow or another there was an incident And in this incident a person was killed and three or four others wounded and there were some shells found that allegedly came from Springfield rifles which is what the troops were using Now from that point on the play as it develops deals with the interaction between seven men in a barracks which I guess is a prototype of the whole unit in terms of the accusations and counter accusations against each other and also a series of investigators ranging from their own captain who was racially prejudiced by to a general who was also racially prejudiced but in a different way We'll talk about that in a moment And eventually the men decided that they weren't going to cooperate and turn anybody in historically

Speaker 1 00:07:58.490
Does anyone really know whether in fact any of these men participated in this raid or the shooting or did they know and not want to tell all of the evidence that all of the research shows that no one knew anything to tell

Speaker 5 00:08:18.980
In fact many of the men when questioned said if I knew I would tell you I wouldn't give up 20 years as many of those men had They were all older men They were all men about 40 except for very few young men in it They said if I knew I would tell no one knew anything There was never one name in all the investigations that went on There was not one name given or unearthed There was never one witness who could identify anybody No one really knows what happened The evidence seems to point to the fact that the people did it themselves basically not only because they were racially prejudiced but because economically they were suffering a hardship There was a girls school at that time that was going to relocate from Utah into Brownsville Texas when they heard that the black soldiers were now stationed there Of course they decided to change their minds They did not relocate So they were suffering financially and all of the evidence indicates that these people were There was never any witnesses never any evidence nothing to prove that they did it except what some people claim they saw

Speaker 6 00:09:35.820
Well one of the suggestions in the play was that the bullets which were found in a very close radius of about five feet when as pointed up when a gun like that ejected ejects far more than five feet tendencies just that they were planted there and at least in the play was indicated that one of them was struck twice which suggests that there were some manipulation

Speaker 5 00:10:02.810
Well they were always all of the evidence including the bullets that were old shells that had been brought from Nebraska that the man kept There was could have been taken by anyone could have been left any place with all of the accusations all of the investigations There were three separate investigations outside of the local one by the captain Nothing was ever on Earth not one witness who could say he did it or I saw him

Speaker 7 00:10:34.490
All right Now that you have given the background we understand something about the Brownsville raid and the situation What about you as an actor What type of things were you You played the role of Corporal Boyd Conyers and you were a person who was initially one of the people who was accused and then you got back and forth with some of the other soldiers How did you feel about this obviously Just from here you talk about it you are very committed to expressing to the public what this incident was all about Now as an actor how did you get yourself into the part What was your part and what are some of the things you tried to project as you dealt with this part

Speaker 5 00:11:18.340
Well the thing I tried to project is that in 19 0 6 and in those times being in the army was a very good thing for a black man It was one of the few jobs he had where he had a pension at the end of 30 years where he had some measure of respect where he wasn't subjected to as much racial tension and prejudice because he was a fighting man It was a good job And these men were proud to be in the army What we found out as we worked for instance the Boyd conscious specifically had three children He had a wife He was a farmer and he was just really trying to do his job the best way he knew how and to support his family He was a simple man a man who was just working along and then when he's caught up in this In fact he was the one who made the statement that if he knew any thing he would certainly tell it because he had a lot to lose his wife was sickly and he was just working along some of these other people in the play

Speaker 8 00:12:28.210
Mingo Sanders and Dorsey Willis and John Holliman etc. were they actually people prototypes of soldiers who were in the unit or were they Characterizations changed somewhat because of various legal problems In other words how closely does the presentation of the various soldiers relate to the way in which they were relate to facts

Speaker 5 00:12:57.820
Charles Fuller the author of the play actually went to Brownsville Texas He went through the archives there the public records he went to the congressional records and he tried to trace down as far as he could All of these men he spent that much time so that the men represented even though they were not in the same company in real life they were in different companies They are real people and their representation is as close as you could possibly get The incidents are real Even their basic characters from what we can gather are the basic characters that we try to present in the play So it is very accurate as accurate as one can get after 70 years in terms of who these men were what type of men they were what they did what kind of soldiers they were their ranks All of those things are right on the money

Speaker 7 00:13:58.120
All right in your presentation or your portrayal of Conyers what scene comes to mind as the one that hit you the most that express most the feelings of Conyers

Speaker 5 00:14:12.430
Well right at the very end of the play Mingo Saunders after we have been cashiered out the man we know that we're going out of the army and there's a chance to maybe turn someone in or to give a rumor to the general congress is the man who says I can't I can't do it I've got to say something I can't I've got three children I've got a wife I've had 18 years in I can't just let it all go I have to do something I have to tell something And then of course that to me is a a tense moment for him a moment of decision Does he go over and save himself by giving them Holman's name who we know has snuck into the barracks and in the moments when the other men say they're not going to do it He finally decides that it is worth the sack He does not in fact tell He doesn't give them the rumor He decides and it's a difficult decision to keep his mouth shut and to be cashiered out and to give up his life per say in order to have a unified front against the injustice

Speaker 6 00:15:25.040
Okay Could you recreate this for our audience and actually give those words that you said and then because I saw the play with that I could help to fill in some of the movements etc. because this was a tense moment The sergeant Mingo Saunders had just been told by the general that if they didn't tell everybody was out and he was planning to do it by I think it was 3:00 4:00 or 5:00 in the afternoon and the men were in the barracks sitting waiting expectantly for their leader who was Mingo Sergeant Saunders when you were sitting on one of the bomb bar and what happened from there

Speaker 5 00:16:03.660
Well as we wait hopefully because I think we all hoped right up until the last minute that this could not possibly happen The sergeant tells us that it indeed has happened and that we are going to be cashiered And he says nobody's going to talk and that's it and we're all going to leave and conscious gets up and he says I can't do it Sarge I've got three kids three of them They depend on me on me

Speaker 9 00:16:33.120
I can

Speaker 5 00:16:35.400
And he sits down and Sgt. Saunders says each man has to do what he has to do and no one will look down on him And at this point the other men begin to say I think we should stand together and all of the men in a period of time stand up to present a united front and Congress still sits

Speaker 7 00:17:02.280
And finally they ask him and he takes a moment and he looks at Harlem and who is the person that he might turn in and he just stands up and he goes along with that probably is the most dramatic moment of the play because it deals with something that black people have been concerned about all the time which is solidarity against the oppression that they have been facing And to see those seven soldiers standing up there with their sergeant knowing that their life is just going right down the drain because they believe in each other and they believe in fighting this oppression and this injustice is really a beautiful thing

Speaker 5 00:17:43.290
And actually it was one hundred and sixty seven men who did that

Speaker 1 00:17:46.830
All of them tonight on solar reason we are talking with author French who is appearing in the Brownsville raid which is being presented by the Negro Ensemble Company at the theater daily in Greenwich Village Those interested in finding out more about this play should call w a 4 8 7 8 2 that's w a 4 8 7 8 2

Speaker 7 00:18:12.660
Now we dealt with what happened with the men in the unit The thing that I found very interesting about the play was the way in which the White officers who were investigating it went about it the captain

Speaker 4 00:18:30.150
Who allegedly was from the north who just to stay in having any relations with blacks even to the point that he would not go into the barracks That's right And then a major who apparently had some patrician or upper class background who didn't like the captain and reportedly understood the coloureds who himself had the same type of bias which he talked about the conspiracy of silence of the college where they wouldn't tell on each other

Speaker 8 00:18:57.960
And then finally the general who was from South Carolina the hometown of one of the soldiers who tried to be buddy buddy

Speaker 4 00:19:08.030
He went into the barracks and he sat down and he patted them and he talked about the fathers and so on And the final analysis each one of them came to the same basic stance namely that they were judged guilty not because they were guilty but because they had to find somebody that's because they were black and it didn't really make any difference

Speaker 7 00:19:27.240
In other words the humanity of individual blacks was lost and all of those people and most strikingly Theodore Roosevelt Matter of fact I found some irony if I caused some laughter in the audience where he says and Emmett Scott who was Booker T Washington's emissary said yes Black people always stand behind the party of Lincoln behind the Republican Party and given the most recent election where 90 percent of the blacks voted for the Democrats

Speaker 8 00:19:59.360
It really was the height of irony and it might well be that this play The Brownsville raid might have been apocryphal in terms of what happens to politicians or any group people who take black votes and black support for granted

Speaker 7 00:20:17.520
And of course that it has a lesson for us today in terms of our monolithic support even of the Democratic Party because the real point which I think that played dramatizes very strongly is that black people had to fight their own battles and that oppression will come in many forms and in any place in any time

Speaker 5 00:20:38.610
Well I think the politically poor Theodore Roosevelt got himself in a jam by inviting Booker T Washington to the White House Now after he did that he was accused again of being a nigger lover and so forth and so he really came down very hard on these the Brownsville people There was a senator Senator Faulkner who protested the Black's case in the Senate and Theodore Roosevelt really worked on getting his whole that man's career just ruined

Speaker 6 00:21:12.100
Yeah this was a scandal Equivalent to almost the Watergate scandal And of course that's one of the things that we as blacks and others who believe in equity have to recognize is that the price of freedom is eternal vigilance Yes And it's that eternal fighting it goes on And speaking of eternal vigilance the Negro Ensemble Company has been vigilant for 10 years

Speaker 1 00:21:34.160
They are second avenue and Eighth Street and such people as Michael Schultz and Lonnie elder the third as to relay Clarice Taylor who's been on our show Moses Gunn has been on a show Rosanne Cash yourself

Speaker 7 00:21:51.390
On and on and on Many of the outstanding black actors black directors black lighting people and so on Have gained their training in the Negro Ensemble Company which really put together by Doug Ward and Bobby hooks and some other people who have been very dedicated and concerned with developing what originally started out to be a black repertory company And as Doug has pointed out it is difficult to keep any actors working 52 weeks a year So basically now you target certainly the River Niger came out of Negro Ensemble Company a couple of years ago is dark all Mars blarney all the ceremonies not man the first breeze of summer most recently which was on Broadway for a period of time even And now the Brownsville raid What's your evaluation you've been in the NSC for some years and it's up and down like all parts of the theater depend a lot on public funding Ford Foundation funding new york state council the arts funding National Endowment for the for the arts funding What is your personal evaluation of your participation in the NSC Negro Ensemble Company and its effect on the world of theater particularly black theater

Speaker 5 00:23:15.210
Well I was there from the beginning which is way back in 1967 and I think what the Negro Ensemble Company has tried to do in all that time is simply to present black theater whether it be American African West Indian historical far show the complete spectrum of black writers and black drama and black experience This has been the aim from the beginning and it is now whether the first play which dealt with oppression in Portugal which is song The Lusitania and Bogie and Angola into our present play which deals with oppression in the United States I think this has been the overall total goal of the Negro Ensemble Company and of those of us who've been there and who go back and who would hope that on as far as theater is concerned to show that there are black writers they have been black writers they're not just new there are plays that people have written for years that just got produced recently God is a guess what was written by a man 30 years ago What was too revolutionary to be done then so it was done 30 years now So the effect on theater is only to do good theater and theater that shows that black people did exist in many areas we are in history even though we don't read it and we don't know about things like the Brownsville raid we were there we were cowboys We did do things throughout the history the 200 year history of America And if we can dramatize it and make people aware of it I think that's that's all you can hope for is a repertory company has a tough job at best

Speaker 7 00:25:05.640
You had Shakespeare repertory companies we've had Eugene O'Neill repertory companies We've shown a KC repertory companies generally around a theme or an artist The NSC really is around the trials tribulations and struggles of black people in general which raises the question as to how is it possible to keep the balance between political and philosophical insight and artistic creativity and excellence

Speaker 5 00:25:33.870
Well I think first of all you have to be artistry at its best Of course raises our level of consciousness It becomes more than just a diversion or a few hours to kill in the theater I think NBC has tried because we don't have a star to build it around a concept of people working together of a unified group of people rather than having a quote one person being a star and the other people just filling in So we hoped that people would come because it is interesting because it is informative because it is exciting theater first before anything else

Speaker 7 00:26:13.260
And I think it is exciting theater Anyone who can go back and recall the River Niger for example or an extremely exciting theater things like the first breeze of summer which were more in Traore group were dealing with a black family as a struggled and so on and now something it deals with one of the blots in our country's history At the same time showing how black people stood tall What are some of things that Doug and the company and you folks plan to do in the future

Speaker 5 00:26:43.530
Well I know that the great Mekdad is gonna go on tour which is a play that was done before through I think the Virgin Islands and maybe overseas in Europe and so on and Doug selects all the plays so he would have to tell you specifically but so far he is the winner I mean he comes up with plays that are both meaningful and dramatic and interesting and I hope he will continue for another 10 years along with that

Speaker 10 00:27:08.400
He plays the sergeant in the play and as we were talking before the show Yeah that's a true to life

Speaker 5 00:27:15.780
Yes it has a lot of water that he runs the NBC and he's done a brilliant job because NBC is still in existence and hopefully will be in existence for many years to come

Speaker 7 00:27:27.510
Of course I'm sure like in any artistic venture there are points of disagreement And one of the things that I have observed among black actors in particular is how even when they disagree with each other they tend to support each other Yes well we have to we have to be both the emotionally and not and artistically

Speaker 5 00:27:47.550
I don't think that any see we've really I it's hard to say this but we have never really had any arguments or any negative vibrations We've always been there to do the job and that's it

Speaker 7 00:27:59.970
We've been really kind of a happy family One of the things that does highlight your work is the quality of your presentations your lighting your staging your sets and so on and four Off Broadway theater That takes a lot

Speaker 1 00:28:12.600
And this is all done by black people too Which is great Tonight on soul of reason we've been talking with author French who plays Corporal Boyd Conyers in the play The Brownsville raid based on the famous incident in nineteen six in which one hundred and sixty seven black soldiers were cashiered out of the army This is presented by the Negro Ensemble Company and you can call w a 4 8 7 8 2 for further information
