Speaker 1 00:00:01.630
Why is black creation the most widely read magazine of black literature today What are the major themes in today's black writing What form of black literature is most expressive of the black experience here Jim Walker book editor black creation discussed these topics on tonight soul of reason

Speaker 2 00:00:39.640
This is Soul of reason a program that will examine the roots of the black box soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University

Speaker 1 00:01:06.040
With us tonight on soul of reason is Jim Walker book editor and advertising manager for black creation a quarterly review of Black Arts and Letters And Jim I am sure the audience would be very interested in the reaction of the public to this magazine which deals with black poetry drama art music etc.

Speaker 3 00:01:26.590
Well I think we'd probably have to go back to the start of the magazine in the late 60s and I think the response then among the students was was quite favorable

Speaker 4 00:01:36.280
Students wrote for the magazine were really very soon now already you have said students now that means that this magazine is affiliated with some university connection yes it's affiliated with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University

Speaker 3 00:01:52.510
It started out as a student publication and has really moved away from being a student publication is now on nationwide circulation and it reaches out into Europe into Africa to the Caribbean And I think that speaks for its response for its popularity

Speaker 4 00:02:09.850
Well it is the only regularly published review of black arts and letters in the nation

Speaker 1 00:02:16.330
Yes probably in the world which says something itself but then many people say well why is it necessary to have a magazine that focuses specifically on black writing and on black arts Well

Speaker 3 00:02:30.250
That's a difficult question of course I think one of the major reasons why it's so popular is that young writers unknown writers get their works published and find a good market good outlet for what they want to say and That's one of the major reasons I think it's popular In addition it's it's it covers just about every field of black arts that you can think of it covers theater covers Drama covers music covers poetry short stories fiction And I think just because it's the only publication of that sort it fills a need that people are looking for when you say people is this mean black people or white people or people interested in the arts generally I would suppose I mean readership is black but of course we go to many colleges around the universities around the nation I really don't know exactly what our readership would be but I would think most of our readers would be black But we do get white writers writing and we get responses from just all sorts of people

Speaker 4 00:03:33.700
One of the things I think is certainly true and that is that black arts is probably the most exciting things happening in the arts because it's an area which has been suppressed the public hasn't heard very much about it and is very expressive of the black experience which comes out of this oppression

Speaker 5 00:03:49.450
So as a result artists who tend to be on the forefront of expression attempt to express themselves and then people of a variety of backgrounds who want to know what's happening in the so-called in community in the black community read the magazine and look for the magazine

Speaker 4 00:04:07.570
But in your opinion what are the themes that are emerging from this literature is being published and you mentioned young writers

Speaker 5 00:04:15.340
But I do know that you've had writers of significance such as James Baldwin and Johnny Williams John Collins Nikki Giovanni writing for the magazine from time to time and you've also featured interviews with some of the outstanding figures in the theater and in movies people like Doug Ward of the Negro Ensemble Company People like Gordon Parks of movie fame So in a sense the magazine isn't just a vehicle as I understand it for young writers although there is plenty of opportunity for them it covers a whole range of people who are in the arts and that would lead me to say that if you looked at the magazine over several issues you would probably have a pretty good idea of the emerging themes in today's black writing and arts What are those themes as you have seen them Well I think your statement suggests the variety that is in the magazine has two themes I think the themes run the gamut from concern

Speaker 6 00:05:22.960
For how we live our lives to where are we going How are we going to deal with the racism in the country Concerns that are sometimes more narrow in the arts How do you get money for theaters How do you Gain publishing outlets I'm not sure that I could easily say that there are any themes that

Speaker 7 00:05:49.030
Really emerge

Speaker 5 00:05:50.860
Well I've shown the magazine to several people many of them white and they say it seems to be a sort of a balance between love and anger hope and anguish A particular I think the thing that catches most people is the poetry that poetry is very graphic in terms of the layout of the magazine It's laid out graphically as well And it is very poignant and direct to these themes of love and anger and hope and despair Is that your observation Or because you tend to be more interested in books and essays Maybe you see the three different themes emerging from those particular forms

Speaker 6 00:06:36.850
Well I would say when the magazine was first started we saw much more anger and not that that anger still isn't present in the writings certainly in the poetry But I think new themes might be emerging One of them is a discussion of love I think a few years ago the poetry really didn't deal with love it didn't deal with everyday concerns of well dealt with love love for black brothers love you Yes I think a lot of it was rhetorical

Speaker 8 00:07:09.100
A lot was black rhetoric

Speaker 9 00:07:10.930
Well is saying that you should love your black brother rhetoric or is that really a true statement No a statement of feeling

Speaker 3 00:07:19.150
I think it's certainly a statement of feel I think is a true statement of course

Speaker 7 00:07:23.560
But why would you characterize it as rhetoric Well when I say rhetoric I mean the outward forms the Sort of standardized ways that emerged in the late 60s give an example

Speaker 6 00:07:41.710
Well in the poetry we've got a lot of poetry dealing with black Queens black kings We got dozens and dozens and dozens of poems We got some very good puns dealing with those kinds of themes those kinds of images and I think once that's done very well then we perhaps need to move on to something else

Speaker 7 00:08:01.150
What we didn't get in the early years were poems were good love poems for example which were now person to person love rather than rather than collective loving person to person love

Speaker 1 00:08:13.300
Well what about the themes that emerge in the essays For example many of the people who are writing essays come from various political orientations particularly the nationalist orientation that black people should collective only work on some particular attack against something in society that in most of this writing has been created by white people Is this a very strong theme or are the themes in the essays and the short stories more idiosyncratic along the line of love and anger and hope and so on

Speaker 10 00:08:54.880
Well I'm not sure that you can know

Speaker 6 00:08:58.630
I think there is a tendency to always want to categorize and to say that things are this or that I think we've we've seen a variety I'm glad to see that variety I'm glad to see that people Are getting away from some of the

Speaker 3 00:09:12.550
Categorize sort of standard ways that were used a few years ago I just sort of reject categorization maybe that's just my own person that probably is a personal thing

Speaker 4 00:09:26.530
We are talking with Jim Walker book editor of Black creation a quarterly review of Black Arts and Letters and we are discussing this idea of just what forms of the arts tend to be most expressive at this time of the black experience We have poetry we have short stories we have essays they are discussions about the dance and about the theater and about music as you respond as an editor of this magazine Which of these areas seem to be most vibrant at this particular point in time

Speaker 8 00:10:02.800
Oh I think clearly poetry

Speaker 6 00:10:04.600
It has been and I think it probably continues to be I think a poem is perhaps the easiest thing for people to sit down and write although there is a tendency to think that once you've written it down then you need not do anything with it Once the emotion comes out it need not be edited or thought about again That perhaps is a mistake But certainly poetry has been the most popular for example we ran a literary contest a year ago And we got some six or seven hundred poems six or seven hundred poems in the literary literary contest as opposed to something like I think about 100 or so short stories and about 10 to 15 essay so clearly poetry is the most popular I think it's the most readily available it's the easiest to

Speaker 11 00:10:55.170
To write down immediately it's the form that allows you to get your anger your emotions your love you

Speaker 12 00:11:00.610
Well it ever out that's true because probably as you say it is is a little easier for poetry to be created

Speaker 13 00:11:09.640
But when we talk about vibrates I'm really talking about the way in which these particular art forms tend to be right on the nervous edge of what's happening in the black experience Which of these art forms as reflected through what appears in the magazine do you think is the most vibrant and I didn't mention films I know that you did your winter issue on black films probably the most comprehensive write up on black films it's ever appeared in the press shutter of a book We also do photography and I know that the black creation ran and photography contest in which there were some really poignant photography So when I asked a question and I realize I'm pushing you but in order to give our audience some idea of the vibrance of this magazine I just like your reaction to which of these forms of black art tend to be most expressive of the vibrance of the black experience

Speaker 8 00:12:06.780
Well I still think I would stay with poetry although as you've mentioned we've gotten some very fine photographs we've gotten some very fine essays in that literary contest we got some beautiful essays poignant essays pointed essays but I still think poetry allows that immediate expression which for example a short story doesn't a short story takes a little more work It takes more care takes some knowledge of certain technical things like point of view Certain other things that you need not have to concern yourself immediately within the poetry for example to take a good photograph You have to know something about photographic techniques Sometimes you can take a good photograph by merely going out with you know with a small camera But I think Immediately you can deal with your problems with your thought excuse me with your thoughts with your emotions with those things that you you feel intimately most directly in poetry where you are doing exactly what I was going to ask you about next

Speaker 12 00:13:14.420
And that is the role of criticism in the magazine I know you're an ideal addition to presenting the original works There are sections that deal with criticism in your instance racism of books criticism of music criticism of plays How responsive has the black artistic and the White artistic community for that matter been to the critiques is black creation considered to be high on the level of criticism or do the artists and the writers and the painters look forward to the criticism or do they get annoyed with the criticism that they accepted what has been the response in terms of the critical role of the magazine

Speaker 8 00:14:00.080
Well I can say very happily that the response for example to the book review section has been pretty overwhelming I get letters pretty regularly from people who either disagree with or wildly agree with or want to write a book reviews which respond to a book review which has appeared So I think that response has been been overwhelming at least from readers I think writers very seldom get a chance to have their writings criticized in in a forum which really perhaps knows what they are dealing with and knows what they're about And I think that's what Black creation is And I think the writer certainly look forward to it

Speaker 4 00:14:42.540
And that's very interesting said knows what they're dealing with and knows what they're about And my interpretation of that is because the writers on the magazine critics are black and because they are looking at it from the black perspective this is a cliché that's frequently used that black critics and Black Guard ranks look at it from the black perspective Could you give us an idea of what you mean by looking at something from the black perspective Well I think

Speaker 10 00:15:11.680
What course is a difficult question

Speaker 4 00:15:15.830
Whenever you have to make explicit what is implicit is difficult because a very easily if you were a moment ago you said well they are writers and the poets and so on respond to the criticism because they understand that we understand where they are coming from Well first of all

Speaker 8 00:15:37.250
I'm a black critic I think that will give me an entree to the writers that will allow me a certain sympathy I think that would not be true perhaps with a white that I feel empathy Perhaps empathy is a better word sometimes sympathy I'm not in that very sloppy sense of the word sympathy but yes a sense of simpatico if we're going to use that word I've been dealing with with black writing for several years now and I think what the writers are looking for is not only A sympathetic or empathetic ear or person but they're looking for someone who can criticize criticize not meaning to find something negative about it but to analyze to interpret which is what I tried to do in my book review is not only to tell what in general the book is about but to really make some constructive comments which speak to the writers which also speak to the general readership for So a person could pick up the book and say yes I can read this book review and perhaps I'll know what it's about what the book is about

Speaker 4 00:16:49.490
But also speaking to the writers I'm not sure that that's done very much in critical writing to the allegation that is made sometimes that is that black critics will not criticize a black work negatively that they will always find something nice to say about it because either they just don't want the negative criticism on the record or else they are fearful of the political ramifications of any negative criticism they might

Speaker 14 00:17:18.420.0000000001164
Yeah well I think that's obviously true I think that certainly has been true I suppose it continues to be true When I first started writing my book reviews I think there was a tendency for me to want to to do that to find something positive all the time I think many times I could find things which were positive which were good and I would begin to deemphasize the negative as I've gained some expertise I've gained some feeling about being a book review editor is writing book reviews I've gotten very much away from that And if there's a book that I don't like I feel that I would say that

Speaker 4 00:17:54.720
Have you ever said it Oh yes Yes Put those books on the shelf and that review No I have said it OK That's one of the responsibilities of a critic of a journalist

Speaker 15 00:18:05.160
Now what about this whole area of support the financial side of the magazine is sponsored by the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York universe right and does have a readership from subscription and newsstand readership but all magazines including some of the very prestigious literary review magazines that have focused on what generally we call Western or white writing have had difficulty surviving What about the kind of support Is there much support in the foundation community in the business community for a magazine of this type And what are some of the other possible ways of keeping the magazine growing Because as your magazine has been successful you've had more and more manuscripts and more and more people want to be involved Yet some of the times your pages the number of pages are limited by the financial circumstances that you might find yourself in

Speaker 14 00:19:12.690
Well first of all I should start off with a comment that any magazine I think except for very few face severe problems Our greatest response has been in terms of getting manuscript We've not had a great deal of trouble there We have had trouble in two basic areas no one is is subscribers people to pay for the magazine through subscriptions rather than on newsstands and then even a more severe problem or more particular problem is getting ads from the business community getting ads from book publishers from record companies Your question points to this kind of question how do we get more ads I mean what does it what does the magazine do to

Speaker 8 00:20:01.980
Really put itself in a good finance just as either support of the advertising community was with a circulation of about ten thousand ten thousand you have a specialized group of people and of course this is true in most literary magazine was beginning to be true more and more with most magazines are general magazines have either been phased out or being magazines of the nature of life and right like right Life and Look which by the way had life had something like seven million subscribers so just the subscribers or having the subscribers even a large number could not survive in all help the magazine to survive will help but it won't make the magazine a financial success We need ads we need ads from book publishers we need ads from record companies we get we need ads from just about anybody who would want to subscribe to buy creation why would they want to put an ad in black creation number one it reaches a particular audience it reaches I think a highly literate highly interested audience it reaches an audience most interested in black arts I would think of record companies would be particularly interested in that since we do just about every issue an article a critique either on a book or on a black musician We always have interviews with Writers With people involved with writing We do articles on the dance So I think that area which hasn't really expanded to the way I would like it to expand in terms of ads I think is is perhaps beginning to open up I'm just undertaking now a campaign to get more ads for black creation And I would hope that there would be people in our audience I would Want to subscribe to black creation and would want to put ads in black creation

Speaker 4 00:21:56.360
Well what about on the editorial and I know that you're the book editor and Jim Barry is the managing editor in chief and Laura Harris Hurd is an associate editor and Fred Beaufort who helped to start the magazine around the West Coast as the West Coast editor

Speaker 12 00:22:18.030
Is there any difficulty in attracting competent and interested editorial people because you've already describe it you literally have hundreds of manuscripts coming in many of them unsolicited but I would imagine some of them solicited but producing a magazine aside from the business phase of it the circulation and advertising the setup There's also a tremendous amount of work involved in the editing the layout there's a decision on your manuscript Do you have a sufficient number of people coming in to become involved in this both as a training ground and possibly as a professional activity on that part

Speaker 8 00:23:02.440
Well you never have as much as you would like Obviously you always want more people to work with you But I think I can safely say that the best area has been the editorial area You mentioned the name Fred Beaufort is the person who started by creation in the late 60s and he worked very hard along with several other people and over the years we've had good editorial response I think that the most troublesome area with black creation now is perhaps not with the editorial end although as I say we could use more you know some more help But I think the major area is getting the magazine out to the stands letting people know about it For example we get many people saying to me Well this is a fantastic magazine I've never seen anything like it I'm wildly supportive of it I say Well have you taken a subscription They say well no And I said well why haven't you

Speaker 12 00:23:50.610
You know and you reach into your little bag and pull out a subscribe All right

Speaker 8 00:23:53.770
Right And I say you know pass the copy along too to a friend pass a subscription blank along to a friend And this is what we need We need ads we need more people to know about black creation that takes money of course And I think the tendency to think because we're attached with a place like the Institute of Afro-American affairs at the University at New York University that we have a great deal of money that's simply not true And a magazine needs to survive on its own it needs to be self-sufficient

Speaker 9 00:24:25.680
Well do you think that the interest that has been catalyzed by black creation and its success will stimulate other groups of interested writers interested artists to attempt to develop magazines or do you feel that there will be a movement to get more coverage of black arts and black literature in the prevailing magazines Of course when you say the prevailing magazines other than the Saturday Review and a couple of others they are not really that many magazines that severely deal with the art So I guess Well I would be asking is with the success of black creation stimulate other black oriented magazines in the literary and artistic vein

Speaker 11 00:25:12.810
Well I would hope so I think competition is certainly necessary

Speaker 9 00:25:16.290
I think you know you need to see not just competition but outlets because if you have hundreds of manuscripts and you're only able to publish you know 10 50 limit the number of a limited number it would appear that there must be a tremendous groundswell of talent that needs to be published Of course this is true about any writer of any color or any background His market is limited whether he's black or white it's much more limited for the black writer and that

Speaker 8 00:25:43.830
Was one of the main reasons why black creation was still say it's more limited

Speaker 9 00:25:47.330
Is that because of the quality of his writing or because of the general lack of interest in the part of some general magazines in black topics are black white

Speaker 8 00:25:56.880
Well I think it's a twofold thing What you say the general lack of interest by many magazines to publish black writers but then also many black writers feel hesitant to send their manuscripts into a white publication they first of all may not know the right one to send it into they may not feel that they receive a receptive response that they'll be looked at And I think that kind of thing has been at least not true with black creation You ask a question will more and more black magazines begin to appear Yes I think you see new black magazines appearing all the time I don't think however you see many magazines which are particularly devoted to the arts More and more of those need to appear Yes certainly true

Speaker 9 00:26:46.530
And probably the reason why not more magazines are devoted to the arts specifically is because of the very problem you talked about before earlier and that is a problem of maintaining the magazines in terms of financial support and advertising support because these types of magazines tend to be very widely read and accepted by people who are interested in criticism but at least to date have not had this wide readership on the other hand Some of your articles at least seem to be very popular written in a popular vein photographed illustrated in a popular vein and it's true that as you get more coverage you may be able to increase your readership even more

Speaker 14 00:27:29.940
OK I see we're just at our time I would like to encourage everybody to buy black creation magazines subscribe to it and Rita well they can get it by contacting the Institute of Afro-American affairs at 10 Washington Place in New York City

Speaker 9 00:27:46.390
