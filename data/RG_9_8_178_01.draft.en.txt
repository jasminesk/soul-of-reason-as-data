Speaker 1 00:00:21.960
This is Soul of reason a program that will examine the roots of the black box soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time

Speaker 2 00:00:39.810
Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University

Speaker 3 00:00:48.900
The main plank in Jimmy Carter's presidential campaign was full employment

Speaker 4 00:00:54.210
Yet nearly a year after his election the unemployment rate in the United States is still over 7 percent which means 30 to 40 percent in the black community Tonight's Only reason we will discuss this important problem with Lillian Roberts is associate director of District Council 37 one of the most important labor organizations in the city and herself a leader for full employment

Speaker 5 00:01:16.290
Glad to have you with us tonight Lillian Thank you I'm happy to be here As we said at the beginning of the show things really aren't going very well In terms of full employment as I can assess at this point Jimmy Carter hasn't really delivered on his campaign promises And as the looting that incompetent the blackout summer has shown people really are edgy people really are poor People really do want and despite all the allegations that people should have just sat back on their hands and not stolen

Speaker 4 00:01:51.220
So I don't think people should steal either

Speaker 6 00:01:53.730
The point is very clear that there is a lot of economic misery in our country and in our city and the week of September 4th through 10 is what is known as full employment week headed by Coretta Scott King Martin Luther King's widow and many of the most prestigious labor leaders in this country

Speaker 7 00:02:15.270
We're trying to mobilize and focus on the need for full employment so as one of these leaders how do you think we can get full employment in the United States of America

Speaker 8 00:02:26.050
Well I think that we are going to have to change our direction

Speaker 9 00:02:29.850
We can't just look at full employment without looking at what it cost us not to have full employment

Speaker 10 00:02:38.160
For instance one person in jail costs fifteen thousand dollars a year a one single person on welfare cost two thousand five hundred dollars a year

Speaker 9 00:02:49.350
One person who is hospitalized because perhaps poor health due to nutrition and other matters cost over two hundred dollars a day

Speaker 10 00:03:01.260
Now we complain about these things separately but they all have all contribute to the fact that if money was used a little differently perhaps we can have full employment

Speaker 11 00:03:11.590
I think we have to assess everything

Speaker 10 00:03:14.250
It's hard for me to deal with crime unless we deal with full employment

Speaker 7 00:03:19.260
I think everyone who's walked the streets of our inner cities is clearly aware of the fact of the close relationship between crime and economic conditions in those parts of the city True there always is more portion of people who will be involved in crime regardless of circumstance And we know that there's a lot of white collar crime in this country it probably cost a heck of a lot more than the so-called street crime People are afraid of street fine of course because of the physical circumstances surrounding it And I too admit that I would be afraid and am concerned about that But the main point is the relationship of poverty and various criminal acts But when you talk about changing priorities and so on You're really talking about turning around a country a society that at one time was based on a three percent unemployment rate Then it became supposedly acceptable for four and then five Now we're riding a seven and as we know it has been as high as almost 9 percent within the past couple of years How can we really make this move Does this really mean more investment on the part of government in public service jobs or does it mean more incentives for private industry The classical economists say well if we sit back and wait long enough the law of supply and demand will take over and people will find the need for new products and they'll start businesses in life But it doesn't really work anymore because we are no longer in a labor intensive economy

Speaker 9 00:04:46.950
Well I guess that will work with the number of us will be killed off as a result of people not having work I mean with the crime you know the death rate goes up crime and in a few riots Yes And so maybe that's what they are waiting for I would not like to wait for that

Speaker 12 00:05:04.860
I think that when we talk about needs you know we have youngsters that don't read and yet teachers are walking around with holes in is in their shoes and we talk about education and having a place in you on that's losing this value too because of unemployment

Speaker 9 00:05:23.090
When we talk about when going to school to become a nurse and yet nurses are walking around also unemployed you know so we have to concern ourselves with the needs of society and then those persons who have the professional know how and have employment in addition to those who are supporting staff would have employment

Speaker 10 00:05:45.900
I'm very concerned that we are not doing a lot of things socially I think that we as a society have to show that we care about each other

Speaker 13 00:05:54.090
If we don't then nobody cares about us and we're saying to the people who are not working and who are not part of what is happening who do not have goals and aspirations because they don't have any reason to have them they don't have money so they can't think about well Next week I may be able to get myself some furniture be able to save toward a car or toward a home They don't have any dreams and when they don't have any dreams and our dreams are gonna be dashed and I think if they had we had jobs and had social programs they could feed into that and begin to care more about each other and I mean that in terms of even the elderly We had programs where our youth that was in high school could be responsible for going by and seeing that there was groceries in the home of the elderly are going with them to the clinics that wherever they had to go there would be sort of a relationship there They would begin to build a relationship that are absent sometimes from the child and the parent and they would be there would be a service rendered at the same time There's so many things we can do to plug into each other to show that we care about each other that's what it's all about I think we are losing that rapidly

Speaker 14 00:07:05.370
I think you certainly right the whole question of the reciprocal concerns for each other has disappeared partially because the enemy of urban living but also because of just the despair so many people face Yet as you describe these programs practically all of them seem to revolve around government funding and many of the so-called critics of government funding are saying well look you put it into another political pork barrel and people get paid they don't show up for work

Speaker 15 00:07:38.700
All you're doing is doing for people what they should be doing for themselves I don't believe that personally But how do you refute those arguments How do you really justify moving large segments of money to employ people under the auspices of government Is that a move toward Big Brother ism is that a move toward no controlling people overly in the society

Speaker 16 00:08:08.670
No I think that if a person is a public service job they earn a certain amount of money they're able to buy some of the commodities that produce jobs in the private industry And we've got to start from that base And then as the demand occurs then of course the company will expand their staff which would mean private

Speaker 17 00:08:32.309.9999999999418
You know this really is the principle behind it's one of the big arguments by the way about how do you get full employment One theory which most comes out the things in economics is that you put money into government to help stimulate as you say new jobs Yes And then people will have the need for consumer goods and then that will stimulate the consumer business Now the classical economic theory said you don't need that because there's a certain amount of waste and loss both in terms of loss of incentive and also loss of efficiency Yet we're not getting very far

Speaker 16 00:09:10.140
I think that was disproved when they laid off the city employees and it hit the businesses who was screaming you know we want their heads We want them out of jobs and then after 60000 people lost their jobs they found out that they were having problems sustaining their staff and many of them closed So I think that the theory of generating revenue through public and I think there should be some tax adjustments for private industry right now that I'm sure that they are having problems because the public doesn't have the money to spend So I think you have to have both But it's got to start somewhere And I think if it started with the public service and with some tax adjustments that they probably could meet and we could have full employment I don't think there's any such thing as we can't I think it's costing us too much not to have it

Speaker 17 00:09:58.500
Well I think certainly your emphasis on the fact it is costing us a lot And if we can have it There are two issues that we really should focus on the two things we should focus on the way in which the National Committee on full employment is approaching this is to thrust all of our energies behind the Humphrey Hawkins bill a bill which has been in Congress for almost two years now Yes co-sponsored by Senator Hubert Humphrey one of the great leaders of our country and the black congressman from California represented Gus Hawkins There's been a lot of quibbling back and forth about Humphrey Hawkins it doesn't provide enough it doesn't give to the right people etc. What is the position of your position and possibly the position of the committee on this Are you standing foursquare behind Humphrey Hawkins Do you think it needs to be modified What do you think about it

Speaker 16 00:10:53.210
I would be standing behind and I think that we could spin our wheels is not imperfect And it's a star in the absence of an alternative I'm behind that bill because we need the jobs we need to stop the jogging and move into some action I'm very concerned about what happened Wednesday night Very concerned I think that that was just a warning And I think that the when you get thousands of people caught up into something we better be listening to what is being said to us And now I'm really very distressed about all the jargon and no action

Speaker 17 00:11:28.310
Well one of the things that's distressed a lot of people particularly the black community really gave President Carter his plurality They got him elected Is that the Carter administration hasn't really done anything other than provide a few public service job to deal with the economic situation The suggestion is they have to stabilize some other things but Carter spent a lot of time on human rights particularly the Soviet Union which is interesting and I would support but not very much attention to the right over your rights over here particularly the question of jobs What do you think it is There's not enough political pressure on him and his advisers or is it that there isn't that much of a commitment to deal with it How do you evaluate

Speaker 16 00:12:15.350
I would hate to be totally negative because after all it's less than a year and already whether he's moved is forceful as we'd like to see a move he's moving more in this those short period of time than I would say the Ford administration

Speaker 13 00:12:36.050
But I would like to see him move much faster in his job area and from what I hear of his welfare reform program I'm very concerned and very concerned because maybe he doesn't understand and he's got to understand if that means that we have to be in the street to make him understand and maybe that's when we have to do I think that presidents and leaders all respond too to pressure And if his welfare reform program means that they see the moneys and the food stamp moneys and all the other moneys they go into for the poor I'll put pool together in order to give jobs to welfare recipients at minimum amounts of money the minimum wage and to supplement it Well then it means that many people would be on welfare all their life and I don't want to see that I think that people should be given jobs because they're given a dignity when they have jobs Nobody wants to be on welfare and to have people who are on welfare the whipping boys of this society I think annoys me because there's a lot of people on welfare because they have no job and they're not proud of that You know I've been on welfare myself I never was proud of And I think that when we don't address ourselves to it we're preparing for generations and generations of people who will have no other way of survival That's all it is And to be on welfare and some of them and they're breaking out of it will show in many different negative ways to society because they feel that they have been wronged So I hope that there will not be such a reform bill that is not going to do what should be done in terms of just outright seeing that people get jobs I think that's an answer to it His welfare reform may take place when people get jobs it may very well prune itself down to a very few people with mothers and children who are trapped there He may find that now would likely have to deal with that job issue first and then he may have less to deal with tonight

Speaker 15 00:14:27.960
So the reason we are talking with Lillian Roberts associate director of District Council 37 affiliated with the national committee for full employment the week of September 4th or 10 is full employment week And everyone in the audience is urged to be alert to this to write to the congress person to call television and radio stations and to accelerate the demand for full employment And I believe the focus now as we were saying earlier is on passage of the Humphrey Hawkins Bill I would think which really suggests that there should be a deluge of letters and telegrams and phone calls A lot of people aren't aware of the fact that the White House number is listed in the phone book You can call information get now you can call the White House and a lot of people call the White House on things against us And basically those of us who are in favor of certain things particular film why don't you call the White House and let it be known

Speaker 14 00:15:21.300
And I think one of the roles of media and programs like this is to alert the public to the fact that yes we too no matter how economically deprived we are have an avenue of contact we can call our Congressperson we can call the president Call it pick up the phone and call the president and tell him that I want you to support the Humphrey Hawkins answer

Speaker 4 00:15:43.870
And that's something it is perfectly legitimate within the Democratic frame of reference

Speaker 10 00:15:48.200
Absolutely and I think the same people who took their time to go out and vote for Jimmy Carter ought to let him know how they feel about it

Speaker 4 00:15:55.740
And that's one of the reasons why people like William Roberts are so important Well let's go back to this whole question of welfare and welfare reform Allegedly the largest part of the welfare bill is to support dependent children children whose mothers have no other form of support in life And many people have looked at this probably the most odious negative has been the so-called Moynihan Report where they said that the reason for this is that like families single parent families and they just running up our welfare And even some vague suggestions that maybe we ought to be doing some sterilization and a few other things Obviously that's far from the truth Undoubtedly there are a lot of dependent children in your view of an ideal reform approach for the Minnesota welfare but for providing a better life for these children and these mothers How do you think this could really be approached because they've tried the work incentive program where welfare mothers and others are given special training The problem is that many times that they finish the training because of the employment picture They weren't able to get jobs

Speaker 12 00:17:13.960
Not only that sometimes it stigmatizes them I don't like any program that it takes a group of people who say you are indeed special and maybe people in their own minds because of the way one talks about welfare and thinks that they are failures and loses before they even get started which is most unfortunate I think the best thing in the world would be to particularly in public service jobs you can take individuals in as trainees and in full time employment and then as the private sector opens up they can find their own way from there and they should be paid the same wage as other work there should be no distinction because that gives them their dignity and integrates them into society and that's what we really want We shouldn't have a string onto them forever more saying you're welfare you're treated differently I mean nobody really wants that I don't care what nobody say I'm never convinced that nobody wants it And that's what I think should happen that they should be they should be the ones really to receive those public service jobs because they could get the training there without any kind of differences shown to them and then from that point they can move wherever the ability would carry them and many other public service jobs now in spite of what people say and I think the politicians find it very popular to use the public servants although they are one and they out of the same pot to talk about pensions and to talk about all other things but they never talk about cutting their own And so I get a little annoyed about that because that the people who work in public service I think are great people And the reason they are is because they get all of the people that no one else wants to be bothered they must service and they do it very short handedly And you will not find among the masses a great deal of help

Speaker 8 00:18:59.870
You may think that you will but you won't hear this some ways And I think that that's attributed to politics because it depends on how high up you're going to be appointing people in the staff There's only as good as its leader And so we are going to have people moving around and appointing commissioners who don't know what they're doing and placing them over people who have been there long time trying out different things and by the time they started getting into their little experiment and they change office again it's going to an impact And I think what we need is more civil service up to a higher level level so that we could have stabilized workforce so we could deliver better services to the public

Speaker 11 00:19:39.890
I've always felt very strongly about that

Speaker 6 00:19:41.660
Are you suggesting then by your statement that the commissioners or the various departments should come up through the ranks Or are you suggesting that maybe people almost at the level of commissioners those almost to the level commission no

Speaker 11 00:19:56.060
I'm a realist and know that every politician wants to have his own man you know in a position that's all right with me But I think we have to have stabilization beneath that and we need to have somewhere in the upper ranks people who come up from the ranks who are fixed in civil service positions so that we don't have an awful dramatic experience with individuals coming in and not knowing that we've gone through the trial and error period starting all over again costing the public I think that's one of the real illnesses in New York City We have training programs that we were able to get through collective bargaining And it's because the union realized that it is the continuous workforce and we must have training programs for our people so that they can use their ability to move forward

Speaker 18 00:20:41.620
And we've had people who have once been on welfare and other things that have gone on to training programs who have become nurses who become technicians who have gained a great deal of dignity and not only for themselves but their family then are able to see a hero You know we don't have enough heroes in our community Always see somebody else that's not working or somebody else is considered by this society as nothing And I think that everybody has something to offer I can appreciate the person who cleans the street because I like to walk down a clean street So that person has his value as far as I'm concerned And if we all begin to think about that then some of the jobs that are supposed to be so onerous has a certain amount of dignity to a cause that I don't make the people think the sanitation job is owners anymore

Speaker 19 00:21:30.100
Got I believe when they announced the job the last time they had some over one hundred or two hundred thousand applications because of the impact of unions jobs like sanitation jobs have become very desirable jobs One of the problems that is not being addressed is I read somewhere that my nineteen eighty five one out of every five people employed in the country will be employed by government by city state local and what they are suggesting when that data is that for a comparable job public employees get paid about 15 to 20 percent more on this net nationally This was a study that came from the Conference Board which is a group of economic analysts I don't know whether it's true in New York or not but there is some feeling that for comparable work the public sector pays better because when a public union bargains they are bargaining against the tax base whereas a private union may not even exist in some instances

Speaker 3 00:22:40.780
You had suggested that in this public service job approach that many people would start in training positions and then they would work into the to the regular position and then they may go to private industry Given the fact that there may be a differential particularly in terms of not just salary which sometimes benefits Is it really realistic to expect that after people get onto the public payroll that they are going to transfer in large numbers to the private payroll

Speaker 20 00:23:09.460
It is realistic because I'm not talking about police and firemen and sanitation workers who are not necessarily in private industry Those are the ones who perhaps may be making more money than as a security guard at a plant somewhere you know But when we talk about a clerical or hospital worker these salaries are higher in private industry than they are in the city Maybe not so much with the clerical work it depends on what level they enter But if you're talking about secretarial skills and things of that kind They are higher and these are the people that we represent And I guess I must speak to them you know But I guess at the time that's really not true that they make so much more money And if it was one out of five to me it would matter if people are working and I don't think it would be one out of five because again I think it would stimulate business and therefore they would be in plant employing many of the people that would otherwise be with the public sector

Speaker 3 00:24:11.890
It is necessarily a negative thing does have a significant segment of your population on public payroll You've probably been to the Virgin Islands and some of the other Caribbean nations where 60 70 percent of the people work for government and one of the purposes of government is to provide services for people That's not necessarily negative I think the real problem is that in a society where an economy where so much of what happens is a function of how many automobiles people buy into refrigerators they buy how many television sets they buy It's like a domino effect so that you don't buy as many automobiles so moral workers get laid off and they don't buy as many cosmetics and so cosmetic workers get laid off and the whole circle

Speaker 21 00:24:58.780
And ideally one of the principles behind Humphrey Hawkins Bill is that there will be some indicators which would enable government to make decisions as to where they would prime the pump with various types of public service moneys and tax incentives somehow or another some economists find this repulsive I think the main reason is that it takes away part of the freedom of there is statistical models because they say things sort of just manage to work themselves out But I've always had a feeling that when you say 7 percent unemployment that means 7 out of 100 people and that means that one of it probably wouldn't be me but it could could be that might be one of those seven

Speaker 22 00:25:44.510
And to what extent in a society do we really allow the poor to underwrite the whole economy of the society

Speaker 20 00:25:55.370
Well I just wonder and I can't go in without asking the question When we talk about the jobs how many of those jobs are in other countries that could be here What business has contributed in terms of bringing about this issue and now they want to talk about it You know I can't help but think about many in the clothing and and tv's and cars and what not Dinner produced abroad and brought over here from us Dubai I think one day they're going to find there'll be nobody buying them because we're not working we're not making them

Speaker 23 00:26:28.040
I think one of the things that you pointed out earlier and that is that the looting that accompanied the blackout during the summer really reflected in a sense of warning sign that you have a lot of people obviously so certain number were involved in crime anyway

Speaker 22 00:26:43.880
But aside from that relative percentage you have a lot of people who just took this as an avenue to reach out and take some of society's goods because they're responding in a sense to Carter's statement sometime early this summer that it's talk about the abortion bill where poor people couldn't pay that It's we know that the world is unfair We know that rich people are better off people are going to live a better life and poor people But the real question is how much better and to what extent should the livelihoods or the lives of the well-off or the affluent be built upon the backs of the poor It's true And that's why anything that your committee can do in terms of Humphrey Hawkins is important of any particular activities you have planned for the week of September 4 to 10

Speaker 20 00:27:31.060
Yes we are going to be asking our members to send telegrams to Congress asking to have that bill passed immediately

Speaker 22 00:27:37.700
And also maybe some people in the audience might pick up on an earlier suggestion to look up the watch line number for the White House and call and let them know that significant numbers of people in a society are concerned about full employment and want to support the Humphrey Hawkins Bill

Speaker 23 00:27:53.630
And as you suggested even with its imperfections you believe that the bill should be supported

Speaker 20 00:27:59.090
Absolutely In the absence of alternatives we can't quibble over a period in a calm

Speaker 21 00:28:04.220
And of course somebody will say it isn't just a period of commerce Question How many people get how many jobs but we can go from there Let's get started Okay Well of course I can see why you're successful as someone active in the labor movement

Speaker 23 00:28:17.240
Our guest on tonight so the reason has been Lillian Roberts associate director of District Council 37 and we've been talking about the whole issue of full employment in our society and the need for everyone to support the Humphrey Hawkins Bill and other bills that will be produced and presented to improve the overall economic picture for people in our inner cities and in our nation as a whole Thanks again living for being a guest on tonight's program Thank you for inviting me
