Speaker 1 00:00:01.800
There are no more than 2000 black Dennis in the United States What is being done to train more black men and women to deal with the dental problems of the black community here Dr. Lawrie Suggs of NYU College of Dentistry discuss this important issue on tonight soul of reason This is Soul of reason a program that will examine the roots of the black box

Speaker 2 00:00:44.830
Soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University

Speaker 3 00:01:06.760
Our guest on the night sole reason is Dr. Dolores Suggs who is assistant to the dean for student affairs at the NYU College of Dentistry And we are talking about this important problem of the need for more black dentists to deal with dental problems of not only the black community but the world at large Great to have you with us tonight Doris Glad to be here Now to begin with how many black dentists are there out of the total number of dentists in the country and then are those black then is how many of them are women in the country today

Speaker 4 00:01:40.000
We have about one hundred and twenty five thousand dentists who are in practice and approximately 1 2 thousand of them are black dentists about 1 percent of the total dentist population is comprised of female dentists And I would guess that a larger percentage of the black population of dentist is female than the general population of dentists

Speaker 3 00:02:05.980
Is that right Yes that's right It might be as many as a hundred and fifty black women dentists in the country

Speaker 4 00:02:12.220
I really can't give you numbers on that but the black dental schools have been less discriminatory toward women throughout the year so that there are proportionately more women dentists who are black than white women dentist who are black or getting into the need for more dentists generally and more black than us

Speaker 3 00:02:33.370
What really is the nature of the dental problem in the black community It's been said that everyone has to go to the dentist at least once or twice a year or should it's also been said at least until very recently that half of the population over 50 years old didn't have their own teeth until fairly recently and in the black community this was pretty rough as well What really is the problem What is the what Why do we need more dentists Why do we need more black dentists

Speaker 4 00:03:00.730
That's a major question now among dental educators and dentists public health dentists And the question has been debated back and forth and I believe now the general feeling is that we have a problem of mal distribution rather than a problem of a shortage of dentists in the country If we estimate dental demand which now is at a level where about 49 percent of the population visits the dentists regularly each year then we have enough dentists If we look at dental need which is different from demand which is what is really out there then we would need more dentists and dental need is higher in the black population because this population has not been treated regularly in the past We have a backlog of needs in the black population so that our older members of the population are in need of dentures

Speaker 3 00:04:04.780
And major major work because we have sort of three kinds of problems in dental field We have a problem with young children and they they will lose their teeth to be replaced by a permanent teeth It is still a problem every other problem of dental caries and then we have the problem in the older population of loss of teeth and periodontal or gum disease Now each one of these things is sort of broken up into specialties in dentistry

Speaker 4 00:04:31.870
Are there many dentist black dentist who specialize or most of them what you might call general practitioners about 10 percent of black dentists are specialist about 15 percent of all dentists are specialists so we do have fewer specialists The distribution of specialists also is different among the black dentists population We have more oral surgeons treating extractions treatment like that and prostate Onyx mean making replacements for those chiefs than that have been extracted The overall dental population has more orthodontist who will be working on the cosmetic aspects of dentistry and that's the thrill that's the extra part that the black population right now can't afford and doesn't need They need more basic service That's right

Speaker 3 00:05:32.110
This cosmetic thing is important in part orthodontic straightening teeth If you have or bite which might affect you but much of what's done has to do with making you look better and whereas that's important for the black community I think the other points that you made are really more more significant now Do black people have more dental caries than white people Do they have more dental problems basically Or is it something is more economically related

Speaker 4 00:06:01.270
Now that topic has been studied quite a bit And even though blacks pre-school age children do not have any more caries than white preschool age populations we have more dental problems in the later years

Speaker 1 00:06:21.190
Why is that

Speaker 5 00:06:23.590
I know I'm asking a science Well I don't care if I live or die But sometimes when something like that comes up just a general reaction to well why are blacks different than whites in certain ways because we are genetically different We've got our diet different because there are cultures where people like you don't have any calories

Speaker 4 00:06:41.980
It's related to health care practices in the home What you really do for prevention What are some of those we talk I'm talking basically about brushing and flossing

Speaker 3 00:06:57.410
Now I don't even know what flossing is because that's something that was with us for a while and then it wasn't emphasized too much Now it's emphasized more Would you tell the audience a little about the relationship between brushing and flossing and why flossing is so important

Speaker 4 00:07:14.380
Flossing is important to clean between your teeth and to get to remove debris from around the bottom third of your tooth And right at the gum line This is the debris which irritates your gums and can cause a condition called periodontal disease So you would need the flossing to remove that debris tooth brushing cannot and cannot do that

Speaker 1 00:07:43.060
So when you get up in the morning you scrub across your teeth That really is inadequate

Speaker 5 00:07:47.050
You really should take really dental floss or this at least once a day I say that's a pretty rough thing particularly for busy people as any alternative and it's such a terrorist no alternative

Speaker 6 00:07:57.710
And this time as a dentist and a dental health educator you are really urging that this be done and that of course relates to something a dentist should do I don't know whether they do it enough when you go to their office do most Dennis now do a lot of dental health or is like you are so busy that they don't have much chance to do dental health education

Speaker 4 00:08:20.380
One problem another problem that the dental profession faces is a shortage of auxiliary personnel Usually the dental hygienist who is the auxiliary personnel who will clean your teeth and give you health education is she's a very high paid individual and she's at a shortage too

Speaker 3 00:08:40.870
I know because one of my responsibilities at New York University at one time was to coordinate the program for dental hygiene as we went to dental health educators and for a long period of time a number of dental hygiene is working in the schools But then as the school budgets got tight the hydrants were cut to sort of a frill which relates to society's attitude in general toward dentistry

Speaker 4 00:09:03.680
Well you say that our society has a positive a negative or neutral attitude toward dentistry dentistry at least among the black population has a very low priority There are other needs right now that are a lot more essential They seem to be more as they are at this point For some people they are more essential I believe we should try to reach a basic level of Oral Health which where you can function properly and not have all of the other kind other kinds of treatment health and social problems that you face

Speaker 6 00:09:47.210
Now let me ask this You're a black woman You're a dentist you're working in a dental college What attracted you to the field of dentistry Because you want to talk a little later about how we need more black Dennis and how to get them But specifically what attracted the worry Suggs to the field of dentistry

Speaker 7 00:10:06.170
I was attracted to the field primarily by conversations with dentists and with mainly with relatives who are dentists We got from a dental mental family and that is a trend generally in dentistry Most people who go into dentistry know someone who is a dentist and get a feeling for the profession before they go into it

Speaker 1 00:10:26.360
That is one of the problems that dental professionals face because in many ways it's it's somewhat like a craft you pay it on a piecework basis You work in one place you work very well with your hands and the like And one of the things that many dental organizations are trying to do is to point up that you know there are opportunities in dentistry for other than members of families other than people who just want to be individual entrepreneurs because dentistry is probably one of the last of the basic entrepreneurial professions and most dentist practice Individually you don't practice practice in institutions is that right

Speaker 7 00:11:05.750
That is correct However a larger proportion of black dentists do practice in institutions than white dentists and vets in public health institutions

Speaker 1 00:11:15.260
And it's really interesting part of that might be due to the fact that since there is a need for public health dentists many of the White Dennis don't feel that they can take the salaries which probably aren't quite as good or is it really because black then is a more altruistic as well

Speaker 8 00:11:37.470
Is the case rather let us talk about what's being done let's not only talk about NYU but all of the country to attract more black young men and women into dentistry as a profession since 1968 I'd say many schools have established recruitment programs and are actively seeking black dentists black applicants to become dentists However since the early 70s now it seems as though more women are being sought than blacks and in many cases the classes are filled with women who are then called minorities

Speaker 3 00:12:24.550
All right well if a student wanted to get into NYU dental school what would they do Very briefly he was a black student

Speaker 8 00:12:31.400
He would call the office of admissions request an application form the telephone number of the Office of emissions at NYU 5 9 8 7 0 5 5 0 9 5 9 8 7 0 5 5

Speaker 3 00:12:48.290
Is that correct All right I think that's really very important What else might they need What are some of the basic requirements they need Very briefly

Speaker 8 00:12:55.670
No they would need one year of biology in college a year of general chemistry a year of organic chemistry a year of physics they would have to take the dental aptitude test during the during their senior year most likely and get very good scores on that examination and there is some finesse a specific girly earmark financial aid at New York University and other dental schools for minority students yes or not That's one thing to look for when applying to dental schools for financial support and a commitment from the school to help you once you get to the school

Speaker 3 00:13:35.820
Yeah I think the presence of Dolores Suggs at New York University's College of Dentistry and your own personal commitment shows that there is an opportunity for black young men and women who want to go into the field of dentistry Well after a student gets this far understands what is requirements are and begins to apply for financial aid and we'll talk about some of the sources and in a moment How does it go about choosing a college I mean how do you What kind of decisions are made and how does he go about that Should a black student try to go to a black college like Howard and Harry or should he go to a predominantly white college Are there more opportunities in the black colleges White Houses What about some of those things

Speaker 9 00:14:19.700
I believe that the black student should apply to as many colleges as he can and not feel as though he might not be qualified for college

Speaker 10 00:14:31.220
Go on and apply if they're interested in you they'll contact you have you come in for an interview And at that time you'll be able to decide if you want that school yourself When you're there to interview be sport be sure to speak to someone if you can in a specialty area that you might be interested in if you're interested in a specialty Be sure to ask for a tour of the school to see what kind of facilities to have available for you What kind of backup they have if they have tutoring if you run into difficulty if they have audio visual aids available for you How adequate the library facilities are there Take a look at the laboratories Take a look at the opportunities and take a look at the students who were there and if you can't speak to some of the students and see how they feel about school

Speaker 3 00:15:22.220
All right now that's quite an order You know a young person applies to five different dental schools all the countryside Are you suggesting that he should just go to all of them and he applies to or just only go to the ones where he's invited for an interview

Speaker 9 00:15:36.200
He will He can really only go if he's invited and get the kind of treatment that I'm talking about And if they're interested in you they will ask you to come in for an interview Well what kind of back ever Howard University does not require interviews You might want to just go and you won't have an interview there

Speaker 6 00:15:55.190
What kind of academic average is required from college work in order to get into the average Dental School a high C or B average would be required That's the minimum that is very minimum requirement based on a couple of career workshops that we've had at the institute It's been pointed out that many dental who tend to look for students who have relatively high average and relatively high latitude scores but many minority students don't have averages that are that high And that's the reason why there are some special programs with the tutoring and a special assistance etc.

Speaker 9 00:16:35.510
What about that situation at NYU for example some schools and NYU is included in this Look at your performance throughout the years and if you've shown improvement if your average is getting higher as you go along through college then you have a better chance for admissions

Speaker 6 00:16:53.300
How important are the science courses or the science courses very important or are there average important to being a dentist What about that

Speaker 11 00:17:02.870
Well that varies from school to school at NYU I would I believe your grades are more important than your dental aptitude test score which is an exam that you can take during your senior year in college and it will cover basic science courses and we'll also have a section which will try to estimate your manual dexterity

Speaker 10 00:17:26.720
It is a visual test but it's going to try to estimate your manual dexterity

Speaker 6 00:17:31.670
Now one suggestion that some people have said is that the perceptual motor test the doctor test isn't quite as important because you can learn some of these skills through through practice and modify I heard one minority dental school student just say that last week that whereas you know he had a fair score actually turned out to be a very fine dentist because he was able to practice Now to what extent is manual dexterity an extremely important part of being eligible for dental school

Speaker 11 00:18:05.730
Well studies released by the American Dental Association have shown that at some schools there is little correlation between a student's score on the perceptual motor section of the D.A. t test and his performance in clinical dental courses so that if you have a low score there you should be concerned about it but don't let it prevent you from applying just go to the dental schools all right

Speaker 6 00:18:34.490
Now when a student finally gets his offer of admission and he begins to search around for financial aid what are some of the sources that specific sources that he might look for or she might look for I know that many schools have their own aid programs such as you have at New York University But what are some other sources are there some sources for funding dental education outside of the individual school budgets and how does the student go about getting into those

Speaker 11 00:19:04.790
Generally speaking there are two major loan sources one on the federal level and another on the state level and the maximums for these loans are each twenty five hundred dollars so that you could borrow up to five thousand dollars from the government each year at most institutions that would be an adequate amount of loans and then indirect grants

Speaker 6 00:19:29.600
I know in medicine there's a national medical fellowship program which supports about two thirds of all black medical students in the first year and those are outright grant it's averaging somewhere around 17 18 hundred dollars

Speaker 12 00:19:44.590
Is any such program for black dentist financial aid scholarship money is limited

Speaker 9 00:19:56.500
I can only say that you have to be prepared to go into debt if you cannot afford a dental education and dental educate the cost of dental education is rising at some schools it's as low as two thousand dollars a year for tuition at a state school

Speaker 10 00:20:15.490
But at a private school we're talking about upwards of eight thousand dollars a A for the first year When you include tuition instruments and living expenses dental school is more expensive than medical school

Speaker 3 00:20:31.120
Of course what this really tells me is that dentistry is becoming a more inclusive profession and in some ways it is not particularly responsive to the needs of the minority community Now to what extent is the dental profession aware of this Do they really want to keep black people out of the dental profession

Speaker 1 00:20:48.010
To what extent is the black community aware that's good I think that really is a crying shame to see a situation like that The cost is escalating and the financial aid is going down This really doesn't make a lot of sense

Speaker 9 00:20:58.930
Well one thing that might be done about it in the near future federal loans might be tied with a commitment for early graduates to practice in shortage areas So this would directly help the inner cities and the rural areas If dentists are required to practice in these areas however there's quite a bit of resistance of course from the students from the Student Yes I It will really only affect the students it won't affect the practitioners who are already Oh I see

Speaker 1 00:21:32.800
I was thinking that the supply and demand question comes into play that the dental he just doesn't want more more dentists around That isn't the question the question is that the students who are in dental school don't want to go to the high density areas they just relate to something outside said about the profession that is sort of the last bastion of underpaid individual entrepreneurism among craftsmen Now that's a sort of a pejorative statement but what you just described sort of reinforces that you've got to have money to get into it and apparently they're not really opening up any easy way for people who don't have a lot of money to get and feel dentistry I think that's something at the minority dental caucus or the National Dental Association really ought to be devoting its attention to because certainly the black population is going to be the one that is hurt by this Well let me ask this question are any recent dental graduates black dental graduates involved in political and social and other activities to improve dental service for minority populations

Speaker 9 00:22:38.290
More black dentists practice and public health agency type programs proportionately than white dentists So then there is a commitment there among black practitioners to serve the black population Most patients are black Dentists are black

Speaker 1 00:23:01.750
Yeah but still it is the sort of paying property I was thinking and things like group practices and things like advocating some type of local or state or national dental insurance

Speaker 6 00:23:14.890
Various things that might affect large numbers of poor people Dental profession to my knowledge has not been particularly in the forefront of searching out these kind of things Now maybe I'm wrong

Speaker 11 00:23:26.470
The National Dental Association has several policies which support distributing dental manpower throughout the country One of their policies statements deals with licensure Currently dentists must receive a license from each state the National Dental Association supports a waiver of this so that you could practice in any state

Speaker 9 00:23:54.040
My feeling is that dental manpower that there is a distribution and distribution problem with dental manpower and all efforts must be aimed at correcting this What it takes

Speaker 3 00:24:09.420
Yeah I think this is true in a number of professions

Speaker 6 00:24:11.620
As I said recently we had a career in graduate study workshop at New York University sponsored by the Institute of Afro-American affairs and it was pointed up at the states of New York California and Florida the so-called most desirable states are the ones that are most resistant to any type of national board licensing in the field of medicine And I would surmise that that is probably the same basic pattern that you find in dentistry These are areas that have a fairly affluent population at least California Florida Good well and New York of course is the world capital and that's where people want to practice so that when we talk about concentration you can see why Dennis want to concentrate in that particular area But there are other things even in these areas that can be done to improve the quality of dental service For example if we had some type of dental insurance or some type of group practice I would think that minority people particularly those who are in unions where they have plans of various types might get better service And then there's another area that you were talked about before the program and that has to do with getting more black men and women in the field of dental hygiene and those ancillary fields where there's some better income than just being a an average assistant and also where they might provide a variety of dental health education services So could you tell us a little something about opportunities in the field of dental hygiene and the difference between the high US and the assistant and the other ancillaries

Speaker 11 00:25:47.920
There are some dental hygiene programs available one at Columbia University that grants a baccalaureate degree and I would suggest that qualified high school graduates apply to some of these programs Many dental assistants find once they're out practicing that they would like to go back and get into hygiene school but they find out then that it's too late because they don't have basic science courses that they should have taken in high school

Speaker 1 00:26:21.430
So for what is a dental assistant has differentiate from dental hygiene hygienist I happen to be aware of this but maybe some folks in the audience aren't

Speaker 11 00:26:29.830
Could you give us the dental hygienist is a licensed individual who is trained in cleaning the teeth and in health education and can work in a chair on her own under the supervision of a dentist And what does she do that this chair basic cleaning of the teeth and health education in California I believe dental hygiene is can have their own offices so that the trend is toward giving more responsibilities to hygiene But in the case of the assistant is basically the assistant basically assist the dentists at the chair side with the patient in the handling of instruments and in the management of the office She has no direct responsibilities with the patient

Speaker 3 00:27:27.520
Well in other words you and pointed up that there are a number of opportunities for men and women in the field of dentistry both as dentists and as dental ancillaries I guess done tonight soul of reason has been Dr. Lori Suggs who is assistant to the dean for student affairs at The New York University College of Dentistry and we've been talking about the need for more black dental personnel both as dentist and as dental hygienist Thanks again for being our guest on tonight So the reason
