Speaker 2 00:00:04.940
Of 43 city councilman

Speaker 3 00:00:06.920
Only for a black and to a Puerto Rican here how Councilman Sam Wright of Brooklyn functions as a councilman in the New York City Council on tonight soul of reason This is Soul of reason a program that will examine the roots of the black box

Speaker 1 00:00:44.610
Soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University

Speaker 3 00:01:04.830
With us this evening on solar reason is Councilman Samuel Wright of the 26 council Matic District in Brooklyn which covers Brownsville and ocean hill East New York Bedford Stuyvesant Crown Heights and that shows that you are really up with your community because that's what it's all about

Speaker 4 00:01:21.000
Glad to have you with us tonight Sam and the same Roscoe

Speaker 2 00:01:24.040
Now everyone knows in New York City has so many problems budget problems crime problems health problems education problems and many of these problems have a direct effect on black people and black residents As a city councilman What is your role the role of city councilman in general and specifically what are some of things that you are interested in in trying to deal with these problems Let's begin by talking about the role of the city councilman because that's something a lot of people just aren't particularly clear about

Speaker 5 00:01:55.140
Well let me say Roscoe that the role of a city councilman is to be the legislative arm of the city of New York And we generally meet once twice a week and more often than not in committees in which we deal with the various aspects of the life of the city of New York a councilman's primarily purpose is to legislate and then to have that legislation so that its effect can be felt from the people of the community that he represents which means that you deal with certain things such as ordinances clearances for new buildings taxes approval the budget et cetera

Speaker 6 00:02:41.070
Is that the type of thing that you're really working on those are the things that we work on as legislators but a councilman's job is really never done because he is the eyes and the years of his community and therefore he must be available to that community or else he won't be a councilman the next time the general elections come along because that's one of the beauties of the democratic process

Speaker 7 00:03:02.880
If you want to call it that matters that at some point in time those who represent us are called to some form of accountability This was at the time when you run for election unfortunately in the black communities many Puerto Rican communities not a large number of the residents who are eligible to vote register to vote and sometimes you find that it's really a small group of people who are really electing our representatives now as an elected official I'm sure that concerns you And I was wondering just what some of your views are on why is it that more of the black and Puerto Rican residents do not register to vote

Speaker 8 00:03:41.610
Well Roscoe I would say one of the main reasons that I've found is that our communities do not have a history of participating in the affairs of the city the state and the country as a whole And therefore they see no direct relationship between their individual participation voting and that participating in the city's affairs by and large We have come to realize that there is a greater interest that we have by taking a greater part and playing a greater role in the cities and especially as we become more affluent as our populations increase

Speaker 6 00:04:21.570
And therefore we began to realize as a group that we need to have this type of participation of course However we have not recognized it as a group I say whole and I'm speaking of the minorities They see no direct relationship between their vote and the actions of public officials

Speaker 7 00:04:42.720
I think that's true of the public at large I think that the recent events of Watergate and so on have certainly disillusion a lot of people took a lot of young people to say well look we elect these people and look what they do on the other hand there is the plus that there is a way of undoing our mistakes sometimes our mistakes very brutal but we can't undo them both through the legislative process through the process the electoral process and also through the judicial processes that has happened recently But that does bring about a certain amount of disillusionment So what are some of the things that you Sam right Councilman Sam Wright are trying to do Get more of the minority people in your community is almost totally minority to get more of the minority people involved in the political process

Speaker 4 00:05:30.770
And I know you get some lumps on your head because whenever you get into the arena that some other people who also want to get in the Arena what are some of the things that you try to do That's very true Roscoe

Speaker 9 00:05:40.270
Let me say that some of the ways that I as an individual councilman and prior to that as an assemblyman have tried to have our community realize that they have a greater role to play is to try to get them involved in some of these different boards and activities that have been going on

Speaker 6 00:05:59.170
I'm speaking now of the local school board in our areas the Model Cities committee in the community cooperations in these health committees that they have set up in the mental health committees All of these types of activities have a way of affecting the lifestyle of a community And if you do not encourage people to serve on these particular committees you will find that not only are you not represented but that other people would do the thinking for you without any input before the special problems that we have in our particular community You name it and we have the problems in these minority communities It does not mean because these communities are poor that there is any special quality that goes into thinking ability poor people can think firstly the fact that they don't have money doesn't mean that they're not able to work out their own solutions and own devices that they would need to solve their problems Therefore that kind of input representation to be responsive to let the persons who are in charge know that you can articulate the needs of your particular community I find that very important and I've tried to stimulate that type of interest in my own community

Speaker 7 00:07:18.970
Well how do you face the criticism which I know you've received that when you get into all of these things you're trying to control the community I mean that's the criticism it's been leveled at you and I'm sure many other successful politicians by successful I mean people who get elected and apparently gain some visibility a spokesman for their communities well yet frequently it is suggested that out of this there's an attempt to control particularly control for personal benefit for personal popularity etc. How do you deal with that type of criticism I know you have to have a thick skin that's number one But beyond that I mean how do you respond to that

Speaker 8 00:07:55.720
There actually is really no response because those who are on the opposite end of your political spectrum of course must have their particular line that they put out and they would say anything that those who are successful in this particular business get involved and it's because of political control I not only say that it's not so but if you stop to answer every criticism that's made of you you will find that your whole time will be consumed answering baseless charges criticisms while the work of what needs to be done will be at a standstill So I do not try to answer it The only way that I find that you do answer those types of questions is by the quality of the people whom you stimulate to take part in those activities They will answer for themselves and I know within my own community that one of the things that I'm most proud of is that those persons who are associated with me will be able to stand up and tell anyone that I never told them what to do that I merely tried to outline to them what the problems are and that try to make suggestions and recommendations and ask them to consult with other people about those same problems and their suggestions or recommendations and let them come away with a thinking basis rationale for their decision And when you have that that's all you really need

Speaker 7 00:09:29.110
Well I think that's a very forthright way of looking at it because in a sense if you do respond to every picayune criticism you do have a problem On the other hand many of these areas involve large decisions about things like where a housing project is place where school is place should you spend the money on an educational enrichment program or should you spend it on a tutorial program or should you spend it on sports or should you work for a recreation center as against the child care center and a lot of vested interest involved in this and in a sense the American political process seems to respond to the largest number of active vocal people which tends to suggest that one way in which people in communities can get their representatives to be more responsive is to be more vocal to be more active and one of the mechanisms of activity in politics is the local political club

Speaker 10 00:10:31.030
And yet the local political club is sometimes the center of all of these controversies that go on between club a and club B as it were What is it what about the role of the political club like some young people said gee I can't get into politics unless I go and join the club that make it whether it's your club or someone else's club to join the club because apparently the political process is structured around that and it's only relatively infrequently that an insurgent who has no particular political club basis is able to get enough signatures on his petitions and raise enough money to run successfully I know you have a very successful political club and I know practically every politician in Brooklyn white black for Reagan affiliated with successful political clubs But how do you deal with that criticism that the political club is sort of a retrogressive form for getting people involved in politics

Speaker 8 00:11:27.430
Well let me say first of all Roscoe that you'll find that the political clubs are now playing less of an influential role in the city affairs of New York City and state as well as our national affairs You'll find that political clubs have only lasted as a forum because they do the work that's required but you will find that many of them have been rendered ineffective and as not of a great tool in the usage of city affairs as they have enjoyed in the past You'll find that such institutions as the local planning board for local school boards the as I've said before the Model Cities area in my own community and some of these health committees have now usurped many of those decisions that used to be made by the club so that the clubs really serve as the repository of people who want to express their differences and come to the person who may be the leader or the elected official to do something about decisions made by the Planning Board or the Community School Board and others where those decisions used to be fashioned in the political clubhouses they are no longer fashioned in that domain They are fashion elsewhere by people who have generally no connections with clubs can be independent and make a judgment based upon what they think is right for a community And I have no quarrel with that because I find that it makes my particular position much easier because there is someone who is from the community who has had some experience some expertise in the matter have dealt with it and they come forth with a decision and then all I have to do is either ratify it or not And that is generally based upon the people in the community who either are for it or against it and not that you way who is most vocal but you weigh whether or not it is in the best interest of that community

Speaker 11 00:13:44.110
Of course the best interest sometimes is called enlightened self-interest and one of the criticisms of the American political process is that people who get into it whether they be big business people or local clubhouse people get into it for various forms of personal gain business people getting into it because it gives them some control and access over properties that might be changing hands or bonds that might be put up for sale etc. or in the case of the allegations against the local community groups who are running things model cities Community Corporation school boards in black Puerto Rican communities the allegation is that many of the folk who joined those boards get into it merely to provide a basis for dispensing jobs to their friends

Speaker 7 00:14:29.170
And of course a certain amount of that has happened but in terms of dealing with the fact that enlightened self-interest leads people to get into politics How do you as a elected representative try to deal with people who projects their own interests above what might be the public interests What are some of the ways of dealing with us I think it's important for our audience to hear because this is one of the problems that keeps young people out of the political process and a little later on we want to talk about how young people can get into the political process

Speaker 8 00:15:03.520
Well I would say that you will find generally an individual who has his own self and grand diamond at heart generally picks a platform over which there's some great community dispute or some program in which the community is all upset about maybe building a project or not building a project a hospital or something like that

Speaker 12 00:15:24.560
But in the long run you can always tell those who are just for their own self and good indictment because they may pick an issue and that issue may be what the community wants at that particular time But in the long run all of the issues all of the other civic endeavors that you have to be involved in and aware of and concerned with after a while a person who only looks at that which is expedient falls by his own weight because expediency is not the answer And so far as good representation is concerned And in the long run they have a way of weeding themselves out Some people are more articulate they can sustain a longer self-interest than others but in the long run the public which has a very discerning eye is able to pick out those who can best serve in public service

Speaker 13 00:16:27.680
Well can the black and Puerto Rican community stand tolerate a forward expedient Political leaders and expedient community leaders always this just something that you have to go through in terms of getting that experience that you say that all groups have to gain in order to be successful in the political process

Speaker 12 00:16:46.330
Roscoe I would like to sort of lay to rest if I can The difference between a black guy and a white or black and a Puerto Rican or Puerto Rican a white politician There really is no difference And even in communities where all the same you have some people who are extremely competent and whether you're black or white that companies it's got competency has a wave of rising to the top because of the experience that the party has and he's able to put forth a point of view that is in the public interest I would like to point out to such persons in the city of New York who in spite of the fact that they come from the community the minority communities have been able to show that they are outstanding public servants And I think mainly of our borough president here in Manhattan Percy Sutton and Basil Paterson who is outstanding in the bin I think serves in many capacities and there It just shows you that if you have talent and ability you're able to raise to rise to the top the same way like Bobby Abrams who served with me in the state legislature He's just a competent individual who is good who puts forth and who was able to project like Basil Paterson and Percy Sutton and many too numerous to to name And the fact that they happen to be Puerto Rican or black or some other racial ethnic group for the public at large it doesn't make any difference They have a way and I speak of the public of discerning through the years those persons who serve best in the public interest And so therefore that it's the same in each individual community the individual communities have a way of pushing to the fore those who are most able and therefore you get the better representation out of those individuals

Speaker 14 00:18:56.990
But in New York City as we said at the top of the show we have two main black residents about a million five Hispanic residents but 45 or so percent of the population is black and Puerto Rican Yet in a city council of 43 city councilman only for a black to a Puerto Rican

Speaker 7 00:19:14.780
And while you might suggest that every elected representative is going to represent the interests of all of the people I think the track record pretty much shows that representatives in a sense have an obligation to reflect the needs of their particular community And in some ways the needs of their particular group advocating causes that seem to or advancing causes that seem to reinforce the needs of their particular economic social ethnic group So what about the allegation the suggestion that blacks in New York City have not been able to seize gain obtain the political power that they should have in relationship to their population

Speaker 14 00:19:58.280
I know that there is a criticism on the part of many white residents have said well gee blacks are getting everything they are taking over

Speaker 13 00:20:04.730
I think these statistics here for blacks out of 43 councilmen and to Puerto Rican certainly doesn't show that blacks and Puerto Ricans are taking over even know in proportion of the total population of the city upwards of 40 some odd percent And that seems to be some type of inequity here First of all what is your thought about whether blacks and minorities should have political power in some way proportionate to their population And secondly what are some of the ways that they're getting more power and being more effective

Speaker 9 00:20:38.740
I would say to you first of all that no one relinquishes power or she has power of their own volition There has to be forward movement pressurized from Those who were being denied that particular sharing of the responsibilities and the power within the city you speak of for blacks and to Puerto Ricans But I want you to know that the only reason that we have those many is because of a bill which was passed in the state legislature that I had the good fortune to sponsor and be able to push through That was redistricting now with the redistricting bill of the city council so that we could increase the numbers for So that there could be more minorities in the legislature because I realized that those who draft the bills I'm now speaking of the reapportionment bills so that they reapportion no one no matter how liberal he may be Reapportionment himself out of power and that means that they don't reapportion them so they make sure that their interest is protected and if a bill has to pass you have to have the votes of those persons who have to vote on it So therefore in protecting yourself and your interests the other fellow has to also be protected and that has a way of preserving those who are already in power

Speaker 7 00:22:10.640
Yeah but it gets back to the other point that you raise You said a politician is a politician as a politician and talent rises to the fore Some white politicians who have good track records might suggest that even though I'm serving a community that's predominately black Puerto Rican I have been successful Why should the district be completely reorganized so that it's totally black and Puerto Rican probably I get voted out of office How do you deal with that and I do know that personally You had the situation the decision to make in your own district as to whether you would run for the Congress when the district was created to have purportedly a black and Puerto Rican majority or whether you'd run for the city council

Speaker 13 00:22:52.450
And as I recall the facts in the case the registration rate of the minorities was so low that you made the assessment that a black or Puerto Rican couldn't win And of course that brings us back to that harsh fact of life that we do have ethnic voting On one hand at the very idealistic level we like to say that people are interested in getting the best person regardless of color or ethnic background that a person is able to serve people of all backgrounds Yet the cold realities of the political life in our society are that people do tend in general to vote for someone of their own background and someone of particular background does tend to represent the interests of his own people better or more forcefully that I say

Speaker 9 00:23:38.770
Well I would like to clear up one thing First of Moscow and that is when the new congressional district lines were created It wasn't a question of whether or not I would run in the congressional district that was created mainly for minority It was because that if I were to run in that particular district I would have to move out of the area where I've been so long associated with and move into another complete community Different from the one that I had been representing And in my own personal judgment and those of my many of my constituents and my personal friends that they did not think that was in our best interest and therefore I elected to remain in the area that I had so long been associated with and matter of fact was born in the year you raised in the year you went to school from that area

Speaker 13 00:24:31.930
And I will have to move to a completely different area and the fact do show that when the election was held a black candidate did not get elected even though the district is predominantly

Speaker 9 00:24:42.220
That's true but I'm not so sure that the case would have been the same if perhaps other persons of more renown renowned personage might have moved into the we not even moved in just randomly in that area because that really is Chisholm area I mean she lives in that area where that new district was created However I elected to remain in my own particular area and did not move over but wanted to become a significant force in the city council in and I believe you coordinate the black and Puerto Rican caucus

Speaker 7 00:25:20.080
If we call it what would you call it

Speaker 9 00:25:22.240
Well I guess that's what they call it But I was merely its first chairman for the first year

Speaker 10 00:25:27.250
We now have Fred Samuels as chairman here from Manhattan and we will vote for him in shipping we thought that was a fair and equitable thing to do so that all of us could have some responsibility and some leadership ability because I think you made a key point earlier that part of being successful in politics is visibility no matter how smart you are no matter how dedicated you are if you do not get the visibility there is a tendency for the constituents not to know you And when the time comes to pull that lever they may pull a lever or someone who is more visible even though that particular person may not be quite as able

Speaker 9 00:26:05.050
Yes I just want to answer your question about the reapportionment both in the city council and in the legislature for the congressional districts No one willingly draws himself out merely because there's been a change or a shift in ethnic balance And therefore what you have is a a attempt for a continuation of representation from those particular areas And therein lies the problem because the large minorities within the city have been sort are carved up in such a fashion So they are not able to bring their large populations to bear And therefore even though the history of a lack of voting from minority communities are true there are enough people in the more recent future who have begun to realize the effectiveness of the vote and they are registering in greater and greater numbers

Speaker 7 00:27:04.900
All right as we come to the close of our program very briefly could you indicate what you think the most serious problem facing New York City is today

Speaker 9 00:27:13.330
Well there's no question about the fact that we along with all the other cities across this country are faced with real serious financial crisis and there is really no place in which we can raise the money that is necessary to continue furnishing the people of this city with services

Speaker 3 00:27:32.500
And therefore it's a question of finances and a question that we're going to have to make some hard decisions and that's where your role as a city councilman comes in and it is important I would imagine for any citizen who has opinions to let the city council and their own city councilman the mayor the controller know what they think about it Absolutely All right Our guest on tonight soul of reason has been Councilman Sam Wright from the 26 council Matic District in Brooklyn and we've been discussing the role of the councilman the city councilman in the New York City political scene There will be a testimonial for Councilman Wright on Monday April 14th and those interested in contacting about this testimonial should call 3 8 5 5 100 Thanks a lot for being our guest on tonight
