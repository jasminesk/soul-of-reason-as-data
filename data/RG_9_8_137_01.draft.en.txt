Speaker 1 00:00:01.640
Each summer some 500 black and Puerto Rican youth in East Harlem and Harlem are served by a major alternative education program called broad jump here What broad jump is about on tonight tonight's soul of reason This is Soul of reason a program that will examine the roots of the black box

Speaker 2 00:00:46.320
Soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University

Speaker 1 00:01:07.050
Our guest this evening on soul of reason is Ron Batchelor who is executive director of broad job which is a major alternative education program which operates in Harlem and East Harlem

Speaker 3 00:01:18.780
Glad to have you with us this evening Ron I'm glad to be here Dr. Brown now broad jump sounds very exciting The lending name itself is exciting it is exciting Sept is exciting

Speaker 1 00:01:28.350
So first of all could you tell us what the name means and then tell us about the concept and how you carry this concept out broad jump

Speaker 4 00:01:37.230
It's not a sports activity and I'll name broad jump means that we want our youngsters to make a broad jump in their intellectual and self development So the term broad jump is meant to mean youngsters we want you to grow and make big leaps into learning and that's how we got our name

Speaker 1 00:01:55.720
I notice you say big leaps into learning and the major focus of the program is the development of Academic Skills and increased self-awareness and development of the potential of young people in all areas And you operate as you suggest mainly in Harlem and East Harlem yet by coincidence your office is 55 Fifth Avenue which is right around the corner from the New School of Social Research in Greenwich Village Why is that just to get us started

Speaker 4 00:02:24.480
Well there are two learning There are several learning centers in broad jump 55 Fifth Avenue as administrative Learning Center where we work where our fund raised where we train teachers where youngsters come to see us However we have several different schools throughout Manhattan where the youngsters come for a six week summer program and a year round follow up so that while I may be located at 55 Fifth Avenue that's where we administratively handle the needs of the broad jump experience But actually the learning environments take place in public and private schools during the summer and during the school year throughout the year So that 55 that avenue is just one of the seven addresses of the broad jump expressway

Speaker 1 00:03:08.550
Some of the other schools Logan we focused on Harlem and East Harlem but I believe a couple in some other parts of the city where are they locate right

Speaker 4 00:03:15.660
We have a broad jump program at P.S. 57 which is located 115 Street in Lexington And that program is for our youngsters who are in the second and third grade We have a bunch of experience at Teachers College Columbia University for seven weeks doing a summer where youngsters who are in the seventh eighth and ninth grade in a coeducational experience work together with a team of 15 teachers and these 15 teachers work with a classroom ratio of one teacher for every 10 youngsters And at this center we help our young people make wise decisions in terms of whether I should take the academic curriculum or should I take the vocational curriculum or should I go into the artists or should I take that big step and become an actor or set these on as opposed to a traditional role function so that the broad sum program has many houses As I mentioned at P.S. 57 at Columbia University the day school the Trinity School are to name someone a few centers where broad jump youngsters learn

Speaker 1 00:04:20.649.9999999999709
Now how does a youngster get into broad jump because you've mentioned that it is an alternative education program and that certainly means something more But what is an alternative education program Does that mean these youngsters don't go to the regular public school or does it mean that this is a supplement to the regular public schools

Speaker 4 00:04:38.820
Exactly we are a supplement to the child's public school experience We do not replace the public school experience what we try to do We want our young people to become more successful learners within the public school system

Speaker 5 00:04:52.050
And we do that by excuse me offering them a seven week summer school program from 9 to 4 and a year round follow up with an alternative because we use different ways of trying to motivate our young black and Puerto Rican Brooks Brothers What are some of those different ways One belief that I share very strongly is that young black and Puerto Rican youngsters cannot grow not unless they feel good about themselves as black and Puerto Rican people And in order to begin at that base we try to provide our youngsters with a set of experiences with competent teachers and I emphasize competent teachers because I believe a competent teacher is a rarity in education the lives of our young black and Puerto Rican brothers so that I have a staff of competent teachers who broke out a series of experiences where our young people go through different plays different musicals and actually have sessions about their lives who they are How do they feel if they hit hear their parents fight What do they do when they get an eviction notice from their apartment How did they feel when they wake up and see the sun and they cannot go into the park and play because the closest thing to them are rocks and glass and a dilapidated school What we tried to do is to get our young people to look at themselves and their lives so that they can feel their self understand their self look at their immediate community and hopefully at the end of the board some experience be able to relate to themselves their immediate community and our larger society which is a big task

Speaker 6 00:06:29.620
Certainly if you are successful at all that you will have been successful at something and very very few people have been successful and in a sense you are successful and we're going to ask about some of the criteria for success but you deal with approximately 500 youngsters which means it s just as very very real number out of literally tens of thousands of youngsters who live and go to school in Manhattan the borough of Manhattan How do youngsters get into the program How they selected by the schools are they selected by you Yes Take youngsters who tend to show greatest promise So do you take any youngster who has a problem How do you really make that decision Because given the fact that you have limited resources and certainly a very large set of objectives you're not going to be able to save every youngster come to you So how do you make the decision as to who gets into broad jump

Speaker 5 00:07:23.500
Most of our young people Dr. Brown our youngsters who are under the normal range quote what normal is of intellectual ability but who have not been progressed enough to that ability and that still includes some thousands of youngsters so that the guidance counselors of various public schools in Harlem and East Harlem nominate each spring youngsters to participate in our program at that time we go through their records and the recommendations and sit and meet with each parent and each child because of participation and broad jump is self initiated The youngsters want to be in a board jump experience Their parents want them to be in a board jumping and experience and the parents are required to participate in the broad jump experience so that while the youngsters are learning various things about themselves their quantitative abilities and their reading skills and this knowledge about themselves We have classes where our parents participate and learn how to fill out certain intricate business forms in terms of employment personnel We go over some of our new maps strategies with our young people so that the work that we do in the summer can be sustained and reinforced when they return at home

Speaker 7 00:08:35.830.0000000000582
Am I correct in that the real core of the broader program is seven weeks during the summer Exactly And then during the regular school year you have some supportive activities I can see the programs going on in these six or seven schools during the summer Now they probably go on all day is that correct

Speaker 5 00:08:56.700
Exactly at a time or a from 9 o'clock to 4 o'clock in the summer for seven consecutive weeks And we work with the youngsters in two different forms in a school year at P.S. 57 We meet with our young people our broad young people after school from 4 from 3 o'clock to 430 and on alternate Saturdays the rest of the programs meet every Saturday for a full day And at that time the youngsters articulate some of their experiences doing a week with our staff people what they're having a problem with at home Trips are taken and our greatest effort that we did this year was to get the entire board jump community together and produce and give to the New York community a program called at home in the sun And what is that home and son Well at home is a son is a play that I conceived and directed and a friend of mine named Nate Moore did some special writing for this program's main objective was to get a community of people together There are parents counselors administrators teachers young people of the Tarboro jump community who got together who never performed before and did a production called at home and a son and this production merely said that we are creative people but one of the strongest forces that exist in our society is the beauty and the force of the home And while the federal government or the State Government and the city government will not take care of our homes we have to be the main source of strength for our child's growth and for our individual grow at home And we had over 1000 people at Wollman auditorium last Thursday to see our production of at home in the sun and the second beauty of production is that kids got a chance to work with adults Some of their teachers administrators because too often our youngsters I said I want you to do a show and I'm going to direct you But this time we all got together and had a community effort which was I think an incredible response

Speaker 3 00:10:57.340
Yes I see the program here and and we see these names Literally dozens of young people's names

Speaker 8 00:11:05.560
We had a cast of 72 people and it was a good production addition to our total board jump community to participate in the production

Speaker 5 00:11:15.550
We had special guests like Alberto Bradford who starred in I can't cope And Roger Darby who was in a hand is on the gate and Joyce Griffith who starred in a part of your system so that our young people got close to people who believe in them A lot of star as a lot of administrators and I think this is very important for the self development of young black and Puerto Rican brothers and sisters to see positive adults who believe in them and who is willing to work with them toward their growth

Speaker 6 00:11:43.110
But you say it's certainly true and I think anyone who sees some of these youngsters performing in activities like this knows about it On the other hand one of the real crises in our schools is the fact that significant numbers of youngsters are not able to read to the level which will enable them to function in society to function in school or to work in the area of arithmetic Some of the other academic areas and I believe one of the main objectives of broad jump in addition to developing and enhancing self-awareness and self-image and self-esteem is to improve these academic skills I agree this is a very very difficult task Could you tell us exactly what you are doing in that area and possibly cite some figures as statistics indicating the extent to which you've been effective in working with this aspect of young people's behavior

Speaker 5 00:12:35.470
Well what I believe what jump we do a tremendous job in affective effective learning and effective learning the attitude to your development But in terms of cognition we succeed also in fact I believe that traditionally black and Puerto Rican youngsters have been told that they were not capable of making growth in mathematics and working with numbers We have proved that as incorrect according to our recent evaluation by Dr. Fox associates that 66 percent of all our young people who participate in a broad jump experience grow in terms of one year or more in their mathematical ability which I think is really incredible because my focus as an educator and as a former teacher was reading and verbal responses and cultural development And while we did have an excellent math consulting and math developed and with our teachers we were never so surprised that our young people would soar so highly on the mathematics evaluation that we provided them And this was shown because we did a pre-test on all our youngsters in June and the conclusion of our program we gave another test to assess their growth during that six week period and also doing in December we gave them additional tests to see how they were growing So the our young people have been testing a lot We have received a lot of information which gives us added strength and insight into the nature of the curriculum that is necessary to help our young people grow in their quantitative

Speaker 1 00:14:13.120
I think you've presented some very clear evidence that certain things can happen and I think most people recognize that practically everyone can learn The problem is that in a complicated society not everybody gets a chance to do so And yours is a alternative

Speaker 9 00:14:28.720
You might even add Supplemental Educational Program which means that you're spending money above and beyond what the society is spending through the regular school budgets in order to help these young people and your organization budget I believe is somewhere in the magnitude of 200 and some odd thousand dollars Is that correct That is correct In order to to do this type of work and you've been successful in getting funding from a variety of sources including many of the private foundations a very prestigious private foundation and also from some of the governmental sources what are the potentials for funding this year We know that government funding is down We know that many corporations have had tough times with the recession We know that the endowments is under foundations have been cut because they too invested in the stock market and stock market is down What are your projections How is your funding hole holding up Because you certainly are doing a worthwhile job It's a question of can you get the resources to do it

Speaker 5 00:15:33.400
Yes there are a lot of government funds that each year go untapped because of the lack of knowledge of a lot of community groups whose efforts are to help the growth of black and Puerto Rican youngsters I have been able and blessed with her a good trustee board and my own self initiative to find out what moneys are available that we could be eligible to to receive this year our corporate allocations have grown foundations have gone down We will receive a government grant hopefully hopefully from title 70 emergency school aid act Last year we received one hundred and fifty two thousand dollars and we were running a few programs to receive such a grant last year and this year we also in the running for a subsequent grant of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars

Speaker 9 00:16:25.890
And speaking of trustees that's what helps to make an organization go As I look at your list of trustees you have trustees from a variety of sources John Baker associate professor at Yale Law School Mickey Grant was a well-known actor actress and playwright wrote Don't bother me I can't cope I have Dave Hepburn vice president Community Affairs w any w you have people like Dorothy or is Assistant Commissioner of state Division of Human Rights Carmel Carden from the veterans office and the Byron Wein who's from a Wall Street firm A whole range of people In addition you have educational consultants including Anthony Alvarado the Community School District Superintendent District 4 Daisy Hicks out of the Board of Education Either Lewis from Essence magazine or Toni Cade is a well known writer etc. etc. I didn't mention everyone's name Now with that type of board you certainly have a lot of support but there are many many organizations in the community that at least supposedly trying to do some of the same things that broad jump is doing as very proudly on the basis of your track record Broad jump is successful

Speaker 7 00:17:42.940
Your per capita cost isn't it It's reasonably high but isn't that unreasonably high So the question that I'm going to ask you now is why do you think that broad jump has been able to attract the type of support that it has attracted and why do you think that it has been successful while some other activities along these lines haven't been quite a success

Speaker 10 00:18:12.920
Initially when broad jump was started a group of business businessmen from the Wall Street area believed that young people and he's talking were not achieved enough for their potential and that was also doing a Tom rather than Martin Luther King Day like Martin Luther King was assassinated and the campuses were an uproar So literally thousands of dollars were pulled into programs like broad And in fact in 1969 program had a budget operating budget over a half a million dollars So you are now at about half of that Now we're down to half of that because it's just we are as opportune a topic as you were in 1968 Black people aren't in as much as they were in 68 right according to the eyes of larger society So that I had to when I became executive director of board jumped literally fight to get public support and belief in a broad jump experience because in 1969 90 percent of the boards of the experience was funded through foundations Now most of our moneys are public moneys so that now we are more in tune into the parts of the government and the community And that's why I believe boards never has lasted that long because of my efforts and because of a supportive community of people who believe in a broad jump experience Unfortunately we as a people have not been given the opportunity to to give our leadership to where I believe we can in terms of educational leadership And too often this society has not reinforced positive strong black leadership Too often they have provided right images and I'm for our young people in terms of leadership and our youngsters when did not see strong black people black men and women fighting in their behalf What I have in my community and my staff have and through our efforts we have gotten our parents excited about the broad center experience so that I could get a meeting of 400 parents at one car because they believe in what we do And I think that's very important

Speaker 1 00:20:17.350
Now how would you translate this experience to the public schools This really is the 64000 question because alternative education has as one of its main roles The role of demonstration the role of being a catalyst role is saying look here's a problem something can be done about the problem and here's the way we think it can be done And as I said your accomplishments are certainly notable Yesterday a per capita cost What is it What is your per capita cost but oh four dollar horns or something

Speaker 3 00:20:51.200
Now the per capita cost for education in New York City generally is what I would say it's like youngsters I would say about a thousand it's up a thousand twelve hundred dollars so therefore what you're really doing is adding about another third to the amount of money that's being spent

Speaker 1 00:21:08.060
And you certainly are being successful and I believe is also true that you have a population that's been selected for you but I don't know whether there have been selected because they have problems or because they have potential A lot Well given that having summarized your experience what did it cost and what you've done What are some of the generalizations that you might want to offer in terms of what this means what this can mean to the public schools

Speaker 10 00:21:44.580
I made a presentation to District Four yesterday and that was the visor Community District 4 and I articulated to the advisory board our accomplishments and the broad jump experience and they are very pleased with the Bridge Program One problem with the school board is that they're unable to in terms of money to embrace new ideas and exciting programs and incorporate them into their experience Too often people at the board of education tend to like to see things the way they have been for a long time And I don't want to be negative I want to focus on the real issue is that led Bush continue to do what he's doing very good and we hope you get money But we want to work to survive to make our programs even better And too often we as a people all people I'm speaking of in general do not want to learn and to interact and to support one another's growth And I think that's one negative aspect because I still don't believe that enough people believe that our young people can learn and so they internalize the fact that our young people can learn all the dad and the teacher about board in the world will not change a lot of those minds and I think that's very sad I think that it is too

Speaker 7 00:22:59.940
And I do think that broad jump and other programs which we haven't mentioned here have shown throughout the country in specific instances that black and Hispanic youth can learn I don't think there's really any serious doubt about that The real question how do we deliver the wherewithal in order to help these young people who might come from different lifestyles might have different type of problems to learn And your answer to my question was what I call the add on theory

Speaker 3 00:23:26.960
I keep spending the money way we are doing it and we'll spend more money we'll get there I my a chance

Speaker 8 00:23:33.840
Yeah you know too often people do not want to spend millions of dollars into understanding assessing assessing the effect of positive self-esteem in black and Puerto Rican youngsters That's a waste of money You know our country will spend two million dollars to eliminate graffiti rather than spend 10 million dollars to try to understand why this response is being made or how can we caught rate this response into our community

Speaker 3 00:23:58.650
But you're still dealing with the ad on theory The question that I'm trying to lead you into is what are some of the things you have learned about teaching in your organization which could be used right today in the existing structure We're spending the same amount of money say that is the add on theory assumes you keep doing the same thing and add on and I'm raising the question Are there some other things that you've learned that might really be done within the context of the money we now have

Speaker 5 00:24:27.300
I have learned one that our young people learn when there are people who are in front of them who believe that they can learn to these things I don't think our new or innovative revolutionary to the young people learn when they are provided with curriculums that will reinforce their understanding of themselves as a people and how these curriculums will help them in this society that is very hostile I think three I have learned that in order to for young people to learn in terms of mathematical growth I'm speaking in terms of empirical evidence that I have seen that all young people have to be taken from where they are in terms of mathematic growth For example do I have time Sure We did a comparative price shopping experiment last summer and most our young people told us they could not do percentage that they weren't capable of percentage And there was something very new to them Yet when I saw them play games of basketball

Speaker 8 00:25:25.860
I saw them computing the averages and percentage in how many shots I said this and this is percentage So what we did we tried to let our young people believe they have the immediate skills are ready Nanda terminology confuses our young people a lot Some of the approaches and styles the didactic styles of teachers confuse our young people a lot

Speaker 5 00:25:47.400
Some of the use of material confuse them but I believe that starting from where they are and building on their strengths and their knowledge to carry them further I don't believe in reintroducing new knowledge or to youngsters thinking that they will grab something that they have no foundation for

Speaker 3 00:26:04.220
Of course you've said something in a number of people education you've said and you admitted it yourself

Speaker 1 00:26:09.420
I think it was coming across my mind as you were talking particularly society of believing that black and Hispanic youth can learn How do you instill belief in teachers

Speaker 10 00:26:19.200
That's very hard And I believe that's something that I could spend perhaps a weekend talking about because teachers have existed in a society that has given them information that black and Puerto Rican people cannot learn And somehow the schools of learning that we have going to an island to Penn State University and Harvard University and I've gone through the whole mechanism of what they consider a good education and I can see from my experiences that this society reinforces that sobriety of the right intellect and that's a big problem that we're dealing with

Speaker 1 00:26:55.680
But of course success images like broad jump and what these young people do and what you yourself do as a role model And I tend to turn this around So you're going to have some progress there The other part of the problem is how do you get schools to do new things you get schools to do new things when they're ready to receive them

Speaker 10 00:27:16.820
And a lot of school systems are mainly ready to teachers Federation's ready to keep all the teachers employed

Speaker 8 00:27:24.820
I think so many there's so many adult interest groups in the school now that we have we have we have forgotten about our young people And I think I'm disillusioned with that

Speaker 3 00:27:34.180
I don't think you really disillusioned because you are out there working with an eye like broad jump

Speaker 1 00:27:38.770
I'd like to mention to our audience that if anyone wants to get further information about broad jump they can contact broad jump at 55 Fifth Avenue in New York City or else call 255 5 5 7 0 Our guest on tonight sole reason has been Ron Batchelor who is executive director of broad jump which is an outstanding program helping black and Hispanic youth in Harlem and East Harlem to develop the type of academic skills and to enhance their self-image and to move ahead and accomplish something in the world about them Thanks for being
