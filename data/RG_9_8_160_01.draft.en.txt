This is Soul of reason A program that will examine the roots of the black box

Speaker 2 00:00:28.420
Soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University The pioneer spirit is flourishing in New York City

Speaker 3 00:00:52.390
Over two dozen nonprofit Urban Development Corporations are reconstructing homes in the inner city Tonight we will meet David Robinson of United Harlem growth Inc To discuss this important phenomenon And David we're glad to have you with us tonight It's a pleasure to be with you Now this is really very exciting development I use the term urban homesteading to describe it and it sort of parallels what happened in the pioneer days when the westward movement When people go out and stake out a piece of land and develop their homes and so on Could you tell us what your company your co-op or a corporation nonprofit corporation United Harlem growth is trying to do and relate that to the general development in this whole area of urban homesteading

Speaker 4 00:01:36.970
Well I think the the basic intent of United Harlem growth is to ensure the survival of its membership and to try to work through and develop a system and structure of dealing with community development which ensures the survival and continued existence and growth of people within the Harlem community Primarily though it though translates to any any low income community in New York or the country And survival as it relates to being able to provide for oneself and one's family a decent safe home which will then foster the growth and everything else that comes with home and family But survival is really the most overwhelming motivation and it's probably been the only factor that which which would have sustained us over over the years that it has taken us to develop and get to the point now where we're actually into close to 50 percent completion on the construction of this first project

Speaker 3 00:02:54.660
And as I understand it the urban homesteading begins with a piece of property that the city is taken over because of nonpayment of taxes What have you and they make it available at a very very low cost to a group of people who will agree to construct their own home on the site now

Speaker 5 00:03:14.470
What is the approximate cost is it a dollar or is it 1000 dollars

Speaker 6 00:03:19.060
There was a there was an existing formula that the Department of Real Estate had which was one hundred dollars per unoccupied unit and I believe the feeling of the city was that there here was abandoned property that was generating no taxes And if they could get rid of it for any amount of money and then have the tax income that the city would in the long run be better off There's something that is a foot now in the Department of Real Estate where the city and it's in its search to find more money is looking at these properties as a potential source of income based on sale And it it seems to be unfortunately there seems to be a more short sighted view of the survival of the city because you know you really don't have a great deal in terms of the value of the property because you're talking about property that's been abandoned for as long as 10 years And really it becomes prohibitive if the acquisition cost is too high to the large number of people

Speaker 7 00:04:22.000
But the city does have a number of units and divisions within the Department of Real Estate and the Housing and Development Administration which allows nonprofit community groups to negotiate with the city to acquire city owned property within their community

Speaker 3 00:04:40.180
And there is a glut of it knowing that in your particular case the United Harlem Growth Corporation how many units as it were Are you working on constructing at this time

Speaker 8 00:04:51.580
We are doing 11 units and we're doing large units we're doing units that have the family in mind are the members of the corporation are family people and we're looking at a situation which is a base for a long range operation within the city So we are giving ourselves adequate space to for both the physical and spiritual survival and growth of the people who live there and how many people in your cooperation

Speaker 6 00:05:29.100
There are some 15 families represented as well as a half dozen or more tradesmen who work with us now in developing this

Speaker 3 00:05:40.320
I gather that there's a lot of work to be done right from the ground up as it were and different people assume different responsibilities as it's based on any previous expertise they've had or is there a OJT on the job training

Speaker 6 00:05:56.850
Oh yeah Oh there is every member of the corporation is no member of the corporation has confronted anything in the size that we are doing now

Speaker 8 00:06:10.230
None of us have functioned in these capacities before we Some of us came with with a varied degree of experience I had a little real estate and construction background but we are all functioning and in an OJT situation and probably the not not the greatest but an equal amount of learning that had to be done was actually studying the dynamics of the problem to figure out exactly what we are up against You know to in order to determine what it is we're gonna do we spent My partner and Mr. David White and I spent and then No All the members of the corporation spent the first eight months to a year and a half trying to understand what it was we were dealing with And at the time we were studying the question of what to do with poor people in the city was one that was in the papers a lot but and we the newspapers and a certain number of periodicals and books were our primary source of information With all the questions that there were and all the minds that they were talking about it answers were not to be found I mean there were no satisfactory answers coming out as to what was going to happen to poor people in the city and what the city was planning to do with poor people

Speaker 3 00:07:28.130
And to this day I don't hear any master plan which includes the survival of poor folk and one of the things you come up with is that if you can get some of these buildings and reconstruct him and become involved in the actual process not only do you get a place for survival but it also develops an ethos that can spill over into the surrounding community which suggests that you have a very creative way of looking at the issue of the survival of poor folk You had said prior to coming on the air that you've also built into your construction plan some federal a manpower type training where as people become involved in constructing their own homes they gain a skill which then they can go out into the occupational market and sell and making and make a living from it

Speaker 8 00:08:16.620
Yeah One of the things that we realized as we got into dealing with the issue was that not only was it necessary to create housing at a cost that we could afford to live in but we also had to have a skill to bring in an income to sustain that house And in a Harlem community where one of the cities you have 50 percent of the people who are trained for jobs that no longer exist you have forty nine percent of the youth according to The New York Times who have virtually no future in terms of skills or jobs

Speaker 7 00:08:54.930
We understood the necessity of training ourselves to be able to bring income to our families and also have some productive skill to work in the community with In August of this year United Harlem growth will be moving into areas of contracting which is where the training that we've had in this past year will be utilized so that the membership of the corporation will stay with the corporation and go on in terms of employment and community development within this nucleus of people

Speaker 3 00:09:40.440
Tell us a little time about some of the backgrounds of some of the people who are in this corporation because it is a very unique idea and it must take some very unique people to stick with it

Speaker 9 00:09:50.400
Give us a little background about some of the people the dynamics of the of the corporation are really extremely good We have we I think believe we started out with a core of five families And the dynamics

Speaker 7 00:10:10.800
Everyone in the corporation has a demonstrated history of commitment trying to find the vehicle through which to benefit the community and self all have worked We've we people have worked from Operation Push to the Panthers to Urban League to whatever

Speaker 10 00:10:32.470
We have a brother who was with the New York City housing police brother Luther Geils and he was the first brother who raised the issue of beards within the housing police So we have a lot of there's a lot of individual strength within the corporate members and a lot of brothers who had been thinking independently long prior to our hooking up And really as we began to hook up it was a tremendous feeling of at least All right Now we're beginning to hook up with some people who are moving in the same direction

Speaker 7 00:11:10.300
And and there was some real strength just just generated out of that But there's a long history of association with the people are our relationships go back some

Speaker 10 00:11:22.150
Some of our members grew up together Ninety nine percent of our members were born and raised in Harlem And one hundred percent of us are in the lower

Speaker 4 00:11:38.410
I don't know what percent a lot percentile of the economic But we're all Everyone is struggling

Speaker 11 00:11:43.330
You're struggling all right now we've gotten your corporation together Could you take us a little bit step by step What you do in this building is available and you have to make this arrangement with the city after that's done What do you do in terms of getting it constructed You have to clear it out

Speaker 5 00:12:00.910
Do you go from there

Speaker 6 00:12:02.590
You once you have your acquisition package or your purchase of the building is tied in with your financing of what it is that you intend to do And once you have at least structured your financing on paper you are able to negotiate your acquisition Once you've acquired the buildings then you are into setting up at an ongoing excuse me construction operation which involves a total demolition

Speaker 7 00:12:32.020
These buildings were abandoned some for seven years A tremendous amount of water damage It's unfortunate that with the buildings some buildings become abandoned and are not in such bad structural shape But the situation is that they are left there for a number of years and by the time anybody gets into them you're talking about a gut job So in some of our buildings we've replaced as much as 80 percent of the beams the floor Joyce's watch So really you can be have nothing but a brick structure to start with

Speaker 10 00:13:02.770
So you have a long period of demolition which is a tremendous operation beautiful because it's it's all unskilled work and folk loved it it's hard work whole things a fire yet you know a sledgehammer work and for people who have been you know frustrated and ready to go that is the best operation along it is being very cohesive because you're working very hard with a group of brothers and you know once you've come through that experience it's really much the rest of the work is much easier because you're dealing with a clean building and level floors and whatnot by the way is any economic fallout from this can you sell any of the stuff that you can you can sell your scrap metals I guess

Speaker 7 00:13:49.120
We don't We don't so much sell we benefit from the demolition that goes on in other areas because we're able to salvage beams we're able to salvage Angelides way But you know they there's there's no economic consideration to demolition you know and so they just tear down stuff and we've we've been able to cut costs moderately by salvaging

Speaker 3 00:14:10.660
All right After you've mastered it and you begin to who does your architectural work do you have to have it OK

Speaker 10 00:14:15.940
You must have an architect it is key to in terms of what you are building you need a professional structure And one of the things that is extremely frustrating is that people coming from a community level saying listen we got we we got We are dying out here Now there's a need to survive and going in very emotionally You get kicked in the tail because there's no emotionalism about real estate development You need a professional team in terms of your architectural component You need to be sharp in terms of your construction management and you need to have the financial capability to carry it out you know because there are as we talked about two dozen groups who are existing within working within in New York There are three times that many who would like to but don't have the group dynamics or the or the finances to carry it out And then of those two dozen there are half of those who are not working because of financial difficulties So it's it's the dynamics have to be precise in order to get over

Speaker 3 00:15:26.380
Now in your case is one of your members an architect JACKSON No No I We all get volunteer architectural help

Speaker 9 00:15:33.600
You can work You can work on spec speculation with an architect speculating that if the job comes through and the mortgage closes he will get his payment out of the mortgage So if you're able to cover his upfront costs That is your relationship with the architect Anybody who is thinking of getting involved with it We got slightly stung with our first architect You know there are architects that work on spec so don't don't don't feed someone else

Speaker 12 00:16:01.800
You know in order to get your your project done because you'll end up throwing away money tonight on solar reason we are talking with David Robinson who's president and director of United Harlem growth Corp. one of some two dozen corporations that are interested in this whole idea of urban homesteading

Speaker 3 00:16:20.550
Now I can tell David in talking with you that you have obviously a very strong personal commitment to this but also until that you're learning a heck of a lot and their expertise as someone in real estate and development is something that is obviously going to spill over to the rest of the people that you are associated with One thing that sort of came to mind as I was listening to you talk is that you really have to know your way around bureaucracies in order to move one of the problems in the inner cities is how do people who have not generally confronted bureaucracies learn to deal with them Now you happen to have had some experiences prior to getting into this It helped you a little with that but just take the whole range What are some of the lessons that you've learned about dealing with bureaucracies and making things move

Speaker 10 00:17:15.990
I can tell you quite as you say we have all learned and we are all becoming quite sharp Keep your feelings at home It is an unfortunate reality that don't nobody care about you know your survival or none of that You know when you run up against a bureaucracy you must have your you must you must listen exactly what they want And you got to deal on their turf because you've come down to their turf in order to survive We had our feelings hurt more times than I want to count because we came in leading with our emotions you know leading with the plight of our community the plight of our families And that ain't even what it's about You know it's about having the dynamics of real estate development that that you need to do to get over And so you must be you must become a businessman you must become a You must be moving towards becoming a professional You have to be moving towards becoming sharp You got to know exactly what you're doing all of it is eventually very precise because you're working with eventually a 3 to 5 percent contingency you know on your whole operation and you cannot if you're going to get over you You must eventually become you know very good in what you do

Speaker 12 00:18:36.360
It's the that one of the main outcomes of the so-called War on Poverty and the community corporations was the teaching of literally thousands of people maybe tens of thousands of people Some of the expertise that is necessary to function within the system because even though many people were involved in the militancy of the late 60s talked about down with the system

Speaker 11 00:18:57.600
The fact is that there has to be some kind of system whether it's this system or another system

Speaker 3 00:19:02.250
And there are certain rules that are involved in working things in an orderly fashion And as you pointed up when you have an error margin of 3 or 5 percent and you begin to build up error here in error there you have a business And one of the things and this has transferred to black businesses as well One of the things that we've learned about black businesses and we've had black business people on the program is that you need to plan what you're going to do and the way you're going to do it And whereas the emotion is you start at the beginning of the program the survival instinct is what causes you to do this in the final analysis Getting it done is going to be a function of the extent to which you clearly think that what you're going to do And I was thinking particularly about you said you had to be careful and I noted the whole area of reading There are so many contracts and statements and we're talking about improving reading of our residents in our inner cities One clear way to learn how to read better is to misread something and to get gets done and to have to come back and read it all over again So you really have a number of collateral things that are happening Are you doing anything to document this process

Speaker 10 00:20:14.370
One of the nice things about construction is that it's extremely physical You know if you come up we have photographs yes of the buildings as they were and as they are now and then we will have photographs of as they will be There are a number of construction journals that are kept in relationship to a project The documentation will actually be in in the the end product itself One of the things that in terms of working with the system or within the system I think that what we are attempting to do is negotiate with the system which is slightly different than working within the system because you come from your own concerns and negotiate Yes on their turf in their terminology you know but you are too to be in the system I think systems by the nature of things really don't aren't structured to work for the benefit of you you know so you step out of that find out what it is that the system the terminologies the system and then negotiate with it You know in the best in whatever manner is necessary for you to achieve your primary objective which is survival in whatever area

Speaker 11 00:21:25.330
That's very interesting you said the system's not made to work for you yet in the body politic the reason why real estate bureaus and health services and hospital view is created ostensibly to provide services to people in the society And of course you said you already said you have to leave your emotions home at least when you begin to deal with them Could you reflect a little bit on that business about your feeling that systems aren't made to work for people or is it something about people who work for systems that don't serve people

Speaker 10 00:22:02.620
I think systems come with a lot of rhetoric you know and the rhetoric can talk about benefiting people but I would if you look at things it's really the chump change issues that the chump change and the scraps you know that are given to benefit the people more in terms of keeping the people satisfied enough you know and alive enough to benefit Again the systems I think it was the Romans who created the welfare state and they did it they created wealth are not so much because there were people who are hungry but they had an element of the population which was starving dissatisfied and it was more efficient in terms of the overall system to give these people some money rather than have to fight a war with them or something So I think that you know systems is unfortunate and I think it's a it's a growing problem because you Know there is an increasing conflict between the systems and people because the dynamics if you look at the if you look at the real estate industry unions came along in order to benefit the working people and it was a very good situation because people were being exploited But as the unions developed they themselves became a system they themselves became exclusive and they themselves then became part of the problem because we now cannot afford to pay a union carpenter a union electrician a union anybody twenty dollars an hour in order to sustain his house in Long Island You know when we cannot because we cannot pay that on a 20 year basis at 8 percent interest So we have had to we are we have to discuss with with with the systems negotiate with the union systems in order to make it clear that we're not in conflict with any systems All we're looking to do is survive and I think it is tremendously important that people within the system the system itself do not see people oriented movements as something that is in conflict with them but more it's something to allow everyone to survive because you come into very big problems when one element of the population doesn't survive based on on on the status quo And that's a much bigger problem than if the system allows itself to open up and give people options to live

Speaker 3 00:24:44.890
Speaking of the unions and building you will have plumbing and electricity to deal with and most of you basically untrained in this How are you going to handle that particular part of your project

Speaker 7 00:24:56.200
We are contracting with professional licensed plumbers and electricians in order to carry out that work Our people will work with those licensed plumbers and electricians in order to gain some of the knowledge Again it's a compromise relationship with the unions We are not using union man in terms of our general labor force but there are people who come from that area

Speaker 10 00:25:18.490
And again I I think there is enough work within this country if this country opens up such that union men can work and sustain their lifestyle at their income level and that low income communities can develop within themselves and sustain themselves The issue for the unions to attempt to take off the low income community is a very it's a very bad situation because you are you are forcing people up against the wall and naturally you will get an adverse reaction But if you if you allow poor people to take care of their own that will free up a lot of the rest of the economy for it for the union people to move into you know the middle income and luxury housing apartment and office buildings all right now I'm sure as a result of your activities a number of people have come to you for advice and assistance

Speaker 12 00:26:08.770
Could you tell our audience a little bit about what kind of advice if any you can give them at this point other than to get a lot of muscle power and some persistence and also you may give them your telephone number so the people who are interested in following up might call you

Speaker 10 00:26:22.240
Yeah I think what just what you said muscle power and persistence is an organizing is the first level understand that you are in trouble you know and then a nobody going to get help you get out of trouble such that you had best begin to deal with it yourself We are it's it's self oriented survival movement We are not out to save the world We are out to save ourselves and anybody can Can we try to assist in what what it was that we did so other people can can copy that our phone number is 8 6 5 4 1 1 8 and we were we're about aiding because our little operation is going to be washed away if there are not 3 4 5 6 dozen groups like ourselves working and working successfully other groups outside of Harlem doing the same thing Yes there are lower eastside the Bronx ocean hill brownsville there are as we saw about two dozen at least two dozen corporations who are organized and dealing on this level

Speaker 12 00:27:30.640
Are there any places in the official bureaucracy at the real estate department where people might get information about this program about urban homesteading

Speaker 10 00:27:38.640
Yeah The Community Management Division city of New York Urban Homesteading Assistance Board known as you have I'll throw out all the groups in the lower resides adopt a building in the Bronx it's people Development Corp. on the East Side and Harlem it's it's the renegades everybody who is about this will aid you know so so just call in and everyone will do the best they can

Speaker 12 00:28:08.000
I'll get on the night sole reason has been David Robinson president and director of United Harlem Growth Corporation and we've been talking about this exciting move an area of urban homesteading those in the audience who want to get information and possibly some motivation from David and his group should call 8 6 5 4 1 1 8 This move I believe and I think you believe David is one of the things that's going to keep New York city livable and also provides for an alternate to the system so that we can negotiate with it

Speaker 3 00:28:42.070
So right on and good luck to you Dave

Speaker 13 00:28:43.750
