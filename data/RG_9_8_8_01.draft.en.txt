Speaker 1 00:00:39.210
Kind of serious drama about black family problems become a hit musical here Virginia capers star of the new hit musical raisin Tell us how it happened on tonight Soul of reason

Speaker 2 00:01:10.830
This is Soul of reason A program that will examine the roots of the black box soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University

Speaker 3 00:01:37.900
With us tonight on soul of reason is Virginia capers star of the hit musical raisin which is based on the famous Lorraine Hansberry play a raisin in the sun

Speaker 4 00:01:48.100
And the question that we were really talking about is how does it feel to be in a hit musical that has been developed from one of the greatest of the Black plays

Speaker 5 00:02:00.610
It feels great

Speaker 1 00:02:02.740
It's absolutely divine or as you know you you really sound like Lena Younger you know

Speaker 6 00:02:12.210
You know it's really just that I imagine just to be in a hit play is exciting but because we have so few opportunities there is a special feeling of greatness and in one essence it is sad that I had to wait so long for this opportunity that there were no roles written during the time that I was in my 20s in my 30s that I could actually be the leading lady that's in essence a sad part but then it's part of the story A Raisin In The Sun that really is the waiting

Speaker 7 00:02:51.760
And but it has come and this moment is here and it is divine And the exciting thing about it is that the people who have been with me since time began in my life meaning my family my mother my father and of course my son coming much later in life and my brother are all alive and well and saw the birth of the person they know he's been struggling all this time when they say go get a job

Speaker 8 00:03:21.730
I have to admit that when I read the reviews and I saw what they had to say about you I said Wow that is out of sight

Speaker 4 00:03:29.600
And that really hurts because what they've said about you in the play is is something and the thing that really has titillated my imagination is the creativity that it takes to translate a I consider a raisin to be probably among if not the most meaningful black play in terms of what we have been about And to translate this with its sensitivity into a musical is really quite an accomplishment

Speaker 6 00:03:57.880
Well you have to first take someone who had who is interested not Jed Walden who is the composer who started out you know Ruth Bowen and her husband She started out he started out in his band when he was 17 years old playing with jazz musician black jazz musicians Now Judd is Jewish but he played with those musicians all the way at the end of high school And he came up in that society and he is the type of man whose life is very intermingled with all people to begin with

Speaker 9 00:04:34.900
On the other hand Bob Britton who is the lyricist his idol was Oscar Hammerstein and he writes with very much of the sensitivity sensitivity that Oscar Hammerstein used to write with you know that the phrasing and bringing together of words taking the very meat of a paragraph and putting it into four rhythmical rhyming lines so you get two young men like this who are not cocky to begin with but want to do a good job who sit down and work for two years before they present anything and then hang in there for another eight years now that you have the love of the work preceding it all And then the love of working coming next And then you have people who are interested and then a dream forms and that dream happens and it's the fulfillment and the creation of that dream into something real something you can touch and feel and get warmth and light from

Speaker 4 00:05:47.020
And of course there is reason now see those two words love and work are really two things that we deal with on soul of reason because as a people we have to love we have to love each other and we have to love what's about us And it takes a heck of a lot of work to do the kind of things that we do in places like raisin or in whatever profession you're in And that that persistence that's that's strength and really that's the strength of Lena Younger and the mother in raising this family moving through all of the historical wanderings of Walter Young Girl beneath her and her boyfriend and so on and that that really is the strength of this And one of the things that I have given some thought to as to whether things are really changed that much for black families from the late 50s to now because some people say well gee we are past that

Speaker 8 00:06:42.450
Yes well that's right That's exactly the question as well

Speaker 9 00:06:46.990
There are obstacles in the middle of the road There are things that we must endure But you know I speak to young people at the schools I go to schools like I was at Taff and I was at satellite Academy and I said when you choose a vocation don't choose something you don't love doing as But it's because it's no fun to go to work I see But if there is something you enjoy doing you can put 20 30 years in it Also when you have a goal in mind and you love that goal and someone's as well listen no one has ever done that before or you can't go there or you can't go there You don't see that yet that that whatever they say goes over your head and all you see is opening that door and you open that door gently so that you don't disrupt that dream you open that door in a way maybe you have to take the hinges off you know But you make a path and you keep on burning through It's 23 years for me to get this way I started late in this business to begin with I started when I was 24 25 years old

Speaker 10 00:07:57.140
And it has taken 23 years to get to be called a star of a Broadway show I have been through bankruptcy I have lost a home I have lost a car Then you would say well why didn't you get a job because nothing filled me as much as what I'm doing And I figured well maybe if I'm never a star then to do something that is related in some way to my feel that I can love as much and the vehicle happened and I was relating all of that so to speak

Speaker 11 00:08:31.640
But the idea is the 23 years I'm not wasted the experience that I bring to the role is personal experience the The love that I have for the work for my work I bring into this show and you can't be too for all that you work with I respect the people I First of all I respect myself I'm not going to do anything that hurts me I'm not going to get drunk and come to work I'm not going to be late and come to work I'm not going to come in and say oh well we're going to walk through it today

Speaker 12 00:09:07.850
No I respect me I respect my craft I love my craft Consequently when I approach my job my it's not work

Speaker 13 00:09:19.290
It's a joy because that's really what black and beautiful is about And speaking of beautiful things and some really beautiful music in raisin And let's listen to one of the really uptempo ones running to meet the man

Speaker 1 00:09:35.100
This is getting out to go to work and that's exactly what it's all about Today The Man Who's Running The Man

Speaker 14 00:10:24.170
Job meant like an army of fame And A Game No way I'm gonna End up swimming My

Speaker 15 00:10:50.300

Speaker 19 00:12:02.390
Good morning Walter it's a lovely day First stop Calumet CEO Jeff noon the stock exchange to 15 pick me up the Athletic Club Jeff Heard you miss that taxi by interest you want to get me killed Yes sir What's that Offer you're not even listening to me Oh yes you're right It's Willie

Speaker 20 00:12:32.000
I've got the money

Speaker 21 00:12:35.380
We've got a talk business And how many black people to run to meet the man Oh no You have to do is go march out in the morning and you can see and the words really are apocryphal They really are

Speaker 5 00:12:55.690
And it's so true You know it's it's just this is a very interesting thing about this scene when everybody starts coming out of the houses and through the steps and whatnot and you see people getting ready they're going to work they're trying to catch the bus and everything and you say you're sitting in the audience and it's become so real

Speaker 1 00:13:14.360
If anybody's ever lived in New York or Chicago and you get that hate anything

Speaker 13 00:13:19.470
Well you're right because it could be Memphis or it could be all ends I could laugh and it is L.A. because this really is the so-called hustle and bustle and what it takes for us to make it Speaking of what it takes for us to make it

Speaker 4 00:13:33.470
I was mentioning my record was playing that is just so wonderful to see so many opportunities for blacks not enough but opportunities for blacks to perform and to choreograph and to direct And what about producing

Speaker 5 00:13:48.950
Are there many blacks in the area of production that you're on my sort of foot You know that don't you

Speaker 10 00:13:56.860
There is money in our community We have businesses and we have those people who have all kinds of dollars and cents and access to dollars and cents All right so maybe maybe you don't want to do something alone on your own All right then so form a group there

Speaker 21 00:14:18.280
You know I hear young people say well the young white girls they can go out and they can come up and they can do this and they can do that and they don't have to have half the talent that we have We've heard that a long time That's a long story Right You know before we can make it we have to be you know second cousin to God and whatever group we have to do a first gets in however

Speaker 10 00:14:39.550
But other people can be accepted on substandard basis And I said well what you're saying is in essence very true those of us who get through are fantastic and there are a hundred more times Andre that are equally as fantastic and can't get through the door But we have to produce our own We have to become a production company We have to invest the money The black doctors the black nurses the black teachers the black mothers and fathers have to find every vehicle doesn't take two and three thousand dollars to get it

Speaker 5 00:15:22.210
In fact I understand one of the lowest investments in our show is two hundred and fifty dollars That's beautiful And realize it's paying money back and a kid did it You know I'd kid invested his summer savings in our show This is when we were in Washington D.C. before the show ever came to Broadway which of course it takes money to bring a show to Broadway Our show cost three hundred and fifty nine thousand dollars to bring to Broadway The average show cost a million dollars to bring to Broadway And the substance of our story is so strong there was no way from the time I knew this was a musical and it was going to go

Speaker 10 00:15:56.440
I never even thought once that it could not be a hit It never entered my mind

Speaker 11 00:16:02.410
But we as black people if we are going to call it our only we're going to do our own thing then we've got to put our money where our mouth is

Speaker 13 00:16:12.370
And what you're saying is that there is money not necessarily a great deal but there is money out there among black Money makes the morning wanted to could invest

Speaker 21 00:16:21.220
Investment is the name of the game to make money You know you work for a living and that's all it's ever going to be a living When you start investing that's when you live above the crest

Speaker 3 00:16:32.860
Well how does a person who is really serious about this black person hear about opportunities

Speaker 13 00:16:40.180
How do they evaluate opportunities because you know the press is filled with stories of people who invested a million dollars in a Broadway show and it lasted two nights

Speaker 1 00:16:49.780
Well you have to be careful what you sail away That's true

Speaker 4 00:16:53.180
And on the other hand I'm sure some of us would like actually become if we haven't already functioning

Speaker 5 00:16:59.710
Let's stop and think about the black shows that have come to Broadway what's in the past what five 10 years Everyone has been a hit That's true All right So true maybe it's not a financial hit But the reason it's not a financial hit is because because of the PR is not done the same way We are just becoming a theater people Well it seemed to me that when I was a child we were theater people we went to the theater you know we went to the theater and suddenly there came a whole area where people went to movies instead of the theater and we got away from it But I remember going across to the Lafayette theater to see a show when I was four years old

Speaker 13 00:17:37.570
You know because that's the vibrance of culture in the black community A lot of people forgotten that we always have

Speaker 1 00:17:43.540
We were able to write Broadway shows you know going back to Ellen Johnson Oh yes I tried it you know

Speaker 5 00:17:51.010
But the thing about it is that people have forgotten They'll spend the same amount of money to go to see and I continued during a concert which I'm not putting down in any way but what I'm trying to say is there is also another cultural experience out there and it's an exciting experience and it's something to see a life drama It's also very interesting in our theater you can always tell that people who are in the theater for the first time because they think they can talk to us like they talk to the screen right You know and you're on stage and they make these open comments you know and you can hear them loud and clear and people are saying you know because you cannot talk to the players and in talking like that you may miss what's going on the stage

Speaker 11 00:18:34.750
Sure there's moments of laughter and of course an actor learns but there when a play is about to be produced nine times out of ten there is someone going around someone reputable just not someone out of the clear blue sky trying to get backing and may have what they call Angel auditions and what it is is that they come and they present a capsule of the play back as auditions are called

Speaker 10 00:19:05.800
Yeah And they they present a capsule of the play the music all the drama and highlights in the drama

Speaker 5 00:19:15.030
And you sit around talk now you don't just say OK that's great man here's my money everything is done very legally and very aboveboard and legitimate companies are formed

Speaker 11 00:19:27.780
You know you don't just have somebody there money because you think this is a good play but there are what they call back as auditions and people get into these back as auditions and you can hear them but you have to become closer to the Broadway scene

Speaker 13 00:19:43.080
There will be more jobs for us when they are more produce and therefore producers and more of us think about the fact of us as possible and thinking about this fact The song that we're about to play now measure the valleys with my play would be something that would certainly turn on the back Oh I hope so Newberry gets to Of the tree When we get As You Measure the Industry Namely drug Made it count

Speaker 22 00:21:12.960
Every time St. When it's taken to Spend measure to Measure the When you know how

Speaker 23 00:21:54.380
How a man comes to be so afraid Oh you know him again

Speaker 24 00:22:12.900
Man Imagine

Speaker 25 00:22:27.150
Have you cried for that boy today

Speaker 26 00:22:29.760
I don't mean your yourself child I mean for them

Speaker 27 00:22:35.080
When do you think is the time to love somebody the most when they've done good and made things easy for everybody It's when he's at his Camp Me So pray And you know Me as you go measure to The

Speaker 13 00:24:09.150
You know that's really a religious experience Of course love always is And of course that's what Raisin is about black love the survival of blacks in a society where we've had a difficult time surviving

Speaker 4 00:24:22.580
And speaking of what we were talking about before measure the values in terms of people who really want to get into production and investing in shows and so on How do they really hear about these things

Speaker 11 00:24:37.430
It's true that there are people around but yes there are several papers that are published in this city show businesses one variety is another And the other paper is backstage and in the back of these papers show all the potential shows that are to be brought to Broadway who are looking for backers as well as performers And you buy these papers and you can read also sometimes you happen to know someone who know someone and they say listen come with me I'm going over here and that's lots the way how it happens

Speaker 13 00:25:11.510
It's kind of a mentality thinking about the roles of blacks and a variety of ways in the Broadway theater

Speaker 11 00:25:18.680
Yes really And the very interesting thing in our show is that the majority of our musicians are black We have men who've been with Duke Ellington and Count Basie and other Oh honey the sounds that come out of that pit are exciting

Speaker 13 00:25:33.410
OK Talking about the sound suppose we close out the show with the finale from this year Oh beautiful Given Me Very And that was the finale of raisin hit play at the forty sixth street theater on Broadway and with us tonight has been Virginia capers star of raisin unlikely Thank you Virginia for being with us on solar reason tonight and telling us all about what's happening in black theater and particularly with raisin Thank you for inviting me It's a beautiful experience and it's a beautiful experience lovely life Thank you
