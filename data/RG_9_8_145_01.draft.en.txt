Speaker 1 00:00:01.390
Black athletes have always excelled in sports in basketball baseball boxing track and field and football too frequently

Speaker 2 00:00:09.850
However the black community is unaware of their exploits here at a younger of the Harlem Professionals Inc Discuss what black athletes are doing today to honor their old timers On tonight's soul of reason This is Soul of reason a program that will examine the roots of the black box

Speaker 3 00:00:48.690
Soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University

Speaker 2 00:01:09.450
With us this evening on soul of reason is Eddie younger who is with the New York City Department of Recreation is a board member of the Harlem Professionals Inc And is one of the legendary basketball greats of New York City Glad to have you with us this evening It's good to be here Dr. Brown I won't tell the audience you know when you were a legendary basketball great but people who watched you in the garden and watched the Renaissance and you've been around they know about it a younger because Eddie younger is a tall man in spirit but a short man in stature probably had the fastest hands in the West That's a really thank you BROWN Thank you All right now let's talk about something it's really very important to me to you And to those of us who've been involved in sports in the nation in New York City that is honoring our old timers First maybe you could tell us something about the Harlem professionals and then you can begin to discuss some of the things that the Harlem professionals and other groups are doing to honor black old timers in sports

Speaker 4 00:02:08.370
Well we have what you call under the umbrella of the Harlem professionals We had the John Hunter memorials scholarship camp fund and we conceiving and constructing a cultural and social program focusing on the historic and current values of blacks in America today The purpose of our luncheon which was held June 21st is twofold to increase awareness of black history to reinforce broaden and carry the roots of ethnic identity deep into the meaning of everyday existence and to provide scholarships to send youngsters youngsters of the inner city to camp during summer because half of it most of these kids

Speaker 5 00:02:45.990
Do not know what green is and what not so we have a chance to send them away to camp And in the meantime on some of our black heroes of yesteryear the ones that paved the way the pioneers who never received any recognition that these youngsters are young black youth do not know anything about if they had an idea what they these people had to go through Maybe they get a different idea what it's all about and get a chance to get more confidence in themselves in accomplishing what whatever deeds they may set out to accomplish

Speaker 6 00:03:20.610
Of course you said something that was very beautiful when you talked about exploring the heritage of blacks and understanding their roots and of course particularly through a program like soul of reason we concerned about the roots and the roots of black people as you know or in music and art and politics and education and certainly in sport And many of the forerunners of today's great athletes like Jabbar and Hank Aaron and OJ Simpson and so on are not known and they represent our roots And when a group like the John Hunter Memorial Fund the Harlem professional gets together to honor them that itself is significant But you're taking a kind of a living memorial namely Raising money to send youngsters to camp which is part of the circle that your organization and Bob Williams organization Sports Foundation in Harlem professionals and so on are trying to do in terms of bringing back to the community something that the community has done for us and then hoping to expand it to help other the other young people

Speaker 7 00:04:32.550
Yeah Well you see like on a luncheon restart his Harlem professional Hall of Fame in 1972 When Hawke and Rucker the late great hall and Rocco was a well known record turnout Yes the well known also we put in Mr. Bob Douglas to own and found of the famous Renaissance which started in 1922

Speaker 2 00:04:55.080
I think the for the audience who doesn't know Bob Douglas Bob Douglas is a gentleman about 92 years old I believe 93 is still involved in the community goes to fairs motivate young people and literally out of his hip pocket carried the Harlem Renaissance team from greatness to be the first major black team to win a national championship in any major athletic competition 1939 he did in 1939 And that's really part of the heritage and to for anybody who knows Mr. Douglass you know the integrity that he still brings to the world of sport I've talked to many people who were in the various pro leagues and they said that Bob Douglas's handshake was just like a contract Devil word meant everything and everything And this is the type of thing that fellows like yourself who played for the renaissance at one time are trying to do that's just one part of it Basketball is one part of our heritage There are other parts of our heritage which are also honored through your Hall of Fame

Speaker 8 00:05:58.250
Yeah definitely like this last luncheon on June 21st We only do Mr. Fritz Pollard He's all American at Brown University in 1919 As pioneer First black all-American I think on campus All American great great he's 83 years old young And if just too bad you couldn't have made that lunch in Dr. Brown just to see if Mr. Pollard we see it's all kinds of awards doing his career in his life and see him when he he got up there and Mike he jeep broke down he stopped crying and then I looked around My wife was crying the great pop Gates was crying Everybody in the audience was crying And Bob Douglas behind him 93 years young tell him could outfits he cut it off Fitzy going back to 1916 which Mr. Pollitt went back to 1960 composed himself and went on to tell how he killed black people black football players were not allowed to kick field goals in those days and that Saturday he kicked three against Princeton He kicked three against Harvard the following week and he came back the following week against Yale and kicked three So these people like like like Mr. Pollard and the rest of the people that we have inducted into the Hall of Fame we tried to bring out to the youth to show them that these were the pioneers These are the guys that paved the way making it for its power is really very important to know that Fritz Pollard well might be the person who started professional football because Fred Fowler was the great football player he was the OJ Simpson then the Joe Namath all wrapped into one of the late 1910s around 1980 1990 and he was he's black doesn't mean to cut you off Dr. Brand

Speaker 4 00:07:51.380
He was the first black to play an organized pro football in 1919 as player calls to the Akron pros when the world's first football crowd in 1990 That

Speaker 2 00:08:00.650
Team followed by the Steelers headed by George Hollis really was the beginning of pro football And in a sense you can say although it isn't just one man but a black man Fritz Pollard was really responsible to a large measure for the beginning of this great football craze and Fritz Pollard is not a big man He's a man who stands about five eight or thereabouts He had a tremendous toll he would pile and he would kick field goals he would drop kick you do everything but you 855 LB he was just a whistle the whistle and people who were following football particularly Ivy League football came out in droves to see him and that was the beginning of great American pro football and everyone white and black alike should know about a Fritz Pollard And when you say that he wasn't allowed to kick field goals that means to score because he was black I'm sure to many in the audience both black and white do you think what do you mean he wasn't allowed He was the best But racism has run so deeply in American sport and American Life that many times the best person who might have been black was not allowed to do it And that is the reason why we need to honor men like Fritz Pollard and men like George Gregory who broke the barriers at Columbia George men like Jesse Owens whom everybody knows But again even a person like Jesse Owens who was the world's fastest human and some of his records probably still stand needed to be pushed into the forefront

Speaker 9 00:09:34.870
Well you take Judge Greg we used to face black college or all American Columbia in 1929 First captain he was captain of Columbia They went to Ivy League titles two in a row And But you ask someone who's Julius Gregory and no one knows

Speaker 10 00:09:54.050
And not only that a man like George Gregory is not in the Basketball Hall of Fame You we know somebody named Joe slots right or whatever anonymous name might be is in the Hall of Fame which reflects the racism which is what Bill Russell was saying when he refused to attend his induction into the Basketball Hall of Fame Because right now there literally only two blacks one is the legendary Bob Douglas as an owner as in any other is Bill Russell who in the Basketball Hall of Fame and anybody who looks at any television set and sees that 80 percent of the players and 90 percent of the top scorers are black has to say what is wrong with the Basketball Hall of Fame Well and I think our audience should know about that and someone might want to pick up their pencils and begin to protest that

Speaker 5 00:10:40.140
Well only as far as the Bill Russell situation that he did not say why he refused to accept the nomination But Mr. Lee Williams is executive director of the Naismith Hall of Fame in Springfield Mass Yeah Yeah People in the paper when Russell rejected this is from The Daily News But we do have black players We have Willie will be Willie Smith We have Zach Clayton We are Bill Yancy Johnny hope Pepe Rix and Tarzan Cooper Now this is what you call a leading why because there's only three teams in the Hall of Fame The buffalo James the buffalo Germans have Marty Freeman And the original started to 1926 27 but they have four in there as individuals Dutch Dennett Joe land at home and Joe Lapchick and Johnny Beckmann Not a renaissance 1932 is in there as a team not as yet but there is not one individual from that 1932 team that won 88 straight games in the Hall of Fame with no end not as an individual only as a group But you see Mr. Williams is as I said before is not telling the truth when he tried to say that they have members in a hall of fame we have no individuals

Speaker 6 00:11:52.870
Of course the least the ostensible reason for this is that they haven't been nominated and haven't been voted on And I think that's one of the reasons why it's important for people like yourself people like myself people in the audience who want these people in the Hall of Fame to go through that arduous process of nominating them getting those forms filled out and then getting votes

Speaker 11 00:12:13.740
Now as Bill Russell said and one of his concerns was that Red Auerbach who was his coach said he had to work so hard to get Bill Russell in the Hall of Fame and Bill Russell said if you had to work so hard to get me in a hall of fame with all I've done for basketball something must be wrong with you And of course the working hard means getting the coaches and the writers who vote for entrance in the Hall of Fame to overcome their racism and elect the best person And that's a very strong charge But I think the mere absence of blacks of no notable blacks who've been players and coaches in the Basketball Hall of Fame certainly reflects this well And I think under underlines the needs of groups like the Harlem professionals to develop these old timers Hall of Fame to honor black athletes so that as more black athletes become identified the larger public will be more willing to deal with will the pitiful part of it is as Tarzan Cooper it take the great Taj and Cooper to Joe Lapchick because on a personal campaign before he passed away to try to get Tyson Cooper inducted into the hall of fame as an individual

Speaker 8 00:13:20.100
Cooper was one of the most devastating players of his era and he definitely belonged into the Naismith Hall of Fame And it's a disgrace that he is not one him fat

Speaker 12 00:13:30.810
Jenkins Pappy weeks pop Gates you name well I understand your organization the people you're working with are beginning this campaign to get Tyson Cooper into the Hall of Fame Basketball definitely yes that's one thing that I think is interesting and you mentioned it very well at some of the white athletes who played against black athletes during a time when sports were segregated have themselves opted for and attempted to promote the blacks that they played against an example as Ted Williams Ted Williams a great legendary Boston Red Sox baseball player when he was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame made as his opening speech the fact that the Hall of Fame did itself a disgrace by not having people in it like Josh Gibson who is a legendary black probably even in the eyes of most whites the greatest player ever to play baseball including Babe Ruth was not in the Hall of Fame They tried to set up a little segregated corner of the Hall of Fame and fortunately some of the White sportswriters and white athletes as well as the blacks objected to this And now you do have an election it is a special election but nonetheless the blacks go into the Hall of Fame just like anyone else And to date Josh Gibson and Satchel Paige and Buck Leonard and Cool Papa Bell have entered the Baseball Hall of Fame as first class citizens And I think that points again to the importance of an organization like yours in identifying and honoring black sports heroes But to move past just some of those individuals let's talk about what people like Eddie younger people like yourself are doing through this program to help inform and enlighten the youth of Harlem And I would say the use of Harlem throughout the nation because actually that is the outcome of your activity Your Honor You give flack so your Hall of Fame but the outcome of the activity is money for the honey ham final and also a whole range of educational and uplift activities for black youth So could you tell us a little something more about the camp and maybe how it came about and some of the things that you're actually doing with some of these youth

Speaker 7 00:15:52.720
Well the camp fund came about when the Harlem professionals they have their pro tournament They were having it up They were one hundred and fifty fifth Street day on 8th Avenue the whole kid rock a playground And when 20 grand John Hunter passed away Those four fellows got together and they wanted to give wanted we put ten dollars apiece And when they donate 40 dollars to the Harlem professionals To have a trophy in honor of John Hunter Now who did you tell the audience who John Hunter was John Hunter was affectionately known as 20 grand He was a fellow that love kids He traveled all around watch the kids try to give them advice to stay in school and leave drugs alone because he came from 130 Second Street Madison Avenue was they all his life and that's a haven for all the addicts And he would try to get these kids off to drugs and to stay in school and make a better life for themselves So therefore we felt that here's a guy that should really should be honored he wasn't a doctor he wasn't a lawyer use a street guy we're just affection He had great affection for the youth So Bob McCullough so will you hold that 40 dollars We will buy it We'll put up the trophy You said Now we can start a camp fund So a Margulis a great great human being who only charms restaurant gave us the rest of free gave us the food he gave us everything free and that's how we started That Monday you told me to come down to his office he gave me a cheque for fifteen hundred dollars to start us off So the first year we sent 20 kids away to camp the second year we sent 33 today I figured this summer we should be able to send 50 to 55 kids away to camp and some of these kids have not They did They've never been away They do not know what it's like to be away Here's a letter that I receive from one of the kids Thank you for making it possible for me to go to camp Mensink leaving on the 9th of August I still think that I'm dreaming because after my father got hurt I knew I wouldn't be able to go anyplace this summer Now I'm so excited I can't wait to get there Thank you again for making my summer complete

Speaker 6 00:17:56.800
That's really beautiful We're talking this evening with Eddie younger

Speaker 12 00:18:00.540
He was a board member of the Harlem professionals incorporated and is one of the founders of the John Hunter Memorial camp fund a procedure that they use is to use the Hall of Fame honoring black old timers and sport as a mechanism for raising funds to send Harlem Youth and other inner city youth to camp those in the audience who might be interested in following up on this should contact the John Hunter Memorial camp fund at f 0 8 0 5 3 4 That's f 0 8 0 5 3 4 for information about the John Hunter Memorial camp fund and Eddie that letter that you read really sort of says it all

Speaker 11 00:18:40.980
It says that you and your colleagues reached out to the youth of the inner city and have said look we are going to do something to help life make life better for you And of course the other part of the circle which I believe you emphasize is that when youth get the experience and have the opportunity to do this they have the obligation to do it to someone else to help someone else And that's the each one teach one one teach reach back and help philosophy that we need in our black communities as we were saying before we went on the air the drugs and the degradation and the school drop outs that we face and as I say and you say the Harlem's of the world the Harlem's of this country our side said those of us who are black with white allies like a Margolies and others need to reach out and do more to expand to extend to help our young people do understand that the way to success isn't through the streets and isn't through drugs and isn't through dropping out of school but the way to success is through trying

Speaker 13 00:19:50.460
And one of the elements of trying is to try and support and that's really what black athletes like yourself have done through the Harlem professionals and through the John Hunter Memorial campaign just like you was talking about the each one teach one

Speaker 9 00:20:05.670
You know you have to Bill Bradley's coming up there talking to the kids you have the Cal Ramsay's coming up there You have everyone coming up there Those that beat the system like the Cal Ramsey's the ED one is the Floyd lanes They come back and sort of lift up come back in and lift up a brother and indeed his pitch to the kids and show them that they can make it Give them some encouragement so that they can goes to put a step forward and in turn turning he's also hoping that these same kids when they go to school they will come back and lift up another brother and it's just each one teach one that's the meaning of it all

Speaker 12 00:20:42.850
And of course it has to be reinforced and part of the background of each one teach one is we say you don't know where you're going unless you know where you've been Kiran So part of knowing where you've been to honor some of the black old timers in sport possibly you could tell us some of the other athletes whom you've honored in the Hall of professionals Hall of Fame I know I went to a luncheon a year or so ago and I was very pleased to see you honored and all black basketball team from Virginia Union that had been the best black college team many many years ago long before black teams played in competition with white teams

Speaker 9 00:21:22.380
Yeah well in nineteen seventy three we put in George Gregory as I told you before for his black and black college all-American and original collegians which is old timers like Joe Steele crip Romney out Eldridge That group they won one hundred and three straight games They freeze black team of play at Madison Square Garden in 1920 70 when the EU championship

Speaker 2 00:21:45.540
We came back and that's one and read it No that's very interesting This team was the first black team to play a Madison zone in 1927 and they would call the Harlem Collegian the original college original collegians

Speaker 9 00:21:59.010
They beat the St. Johns 1 to 5 people who do not know that they know a lot of people don't know

Speaker 14 00:22:03.780
Thank you

Speaker 2 00:22:04.820
Five St. John's one of five was from St. John's University which was very interesting in that St. John's was a Catholic institution yet they had a number of people who weren't Catholic on the team were correct and did a tremendous task in winning games as part of this pluralism that we reflect in sports and reflect New York So when people talk about the 1 to 5 basketball certainly has changed

Speaker 14 00:22:28.710
They used to have the Senate jump and all that kind of played Nikki and again go outside 29 to 26 or something like that

Speaker 2 00:22:36.810
But the world has changed But at the time when you're first playing at sport whatever it is and you're the top you are the top And I think it's very important for our audience to know that as far back as 1927 the top a youth team was a black team the black team

Speaker 9 00:22:53.310
We came back in nineteen seventy four We inducted the great legendary Paul Robeson

Speaker 6 00:22:58.890
Now that is a story the story of Paul Robeson is a story that not only is a story that has sports impact but has far greater human and political impact because here's a man who was crucified because of his political beliefs a man of great artistic talent a man of great humanistic concern a man of great sports talent

Speaker 11 00:23:17.850
And you did do the thing and I know Bob Douglas was related to this as well because he knew Paul Robeson You did do the thing that honored Paul Robeson for his fantastic sports exploits an All-American at Rutgers and football a letter man and baseball and track in boxing and in basketball a Phi Beta Kappa and then going on to win the great awards of the Broadway stage

Speaker 9 00:23:44.880
Did you know that one one fellow picked all-American when Paul Robeson was playing rather than picking Levin and put Paul Robeson on

Speaker 4 00:23:51.960
He picked 10 pick 10 many fields to put Paul Rose's name down and he couldn't put anyone else name there in his place So after Paul Robeson no Eddie

Speaker 2 00:24:03.810
You know sometimes when you hear a story like that you really wonder just how deep racism must run when somebody can just violate the basic instincts of intelligence and humanity to do something like that

Speaker 12 00:24:17.280
Those of us who are black have seen it happen over and over again but every time you hear something as stupid as that you really have to reflect on the depth with which racism penetrates our society

Speaker 9 00:24:30.570
We also inducted Althea Gibson Jackie Robinson Reverend Johnny Johnson first black player at Columbia the first black college all-American team in 1939 It's the first team that was picked by the Pittsburgh Courier I don't know it was they went through I think it was 100 110 sportswriters picked this team This was an all black team It's all black team the black colleges in 1939 He got this out of the shambo collection It's up there for Philly youth to go up there and looked in to see who these pioneers were They had the players from Virginia Union we had the players from Clark from Atlanta Georgia and all the various colleges throughout the South that formed this team They picked 10 men and we honored them last year along with Joe Lewis

Speaker 12 00:25:24.150
Now one of the things that comes to mind as we talk about blacks in sport is whether as we look at the accomplishments of our black sports heroes of the past our young people who are going into sports into the major sports recognize their obligation to their people I recognize their obligation to help other young people because so much of what we read is multimillion dollar contracts and young high school kids running out and buying Mark fours and all kind of clothes the minute they sign To what extent are you and other black athletes of yester year trying to influence the Black Athlete of today to have a greater degree of social responsibility

Speaker 7 00:26:15.920
What we preach Well we've been trying to get the athletes of today to do to come back and give something back into the community You received so much from the community

Speaker 15 00:26:25.340
I think it's an obligation on your part on their part to come back and contribute something to the community as far is given these kids these children hope telling them that stay in school leave the drugs alone All these kids these kids come up they looking at the Cadillacs in the Mercedes Benz and they are the ones these guys the drug sellers are the ones that Receive the respect for the police they're the ones they have all the girlfriends So these kids when they come up on the is this is all they see now we can get some of these athletes to come back and show them the other side of it This is the point We can I think that we can really change some of the ideas that these kids have that the monetary things it just doesn't make sense Just look at the big one a big house and a big Cadillac a big Mercedes and all these material things There's something that you have to you have to live within yourself You have to help your brother You have to help your community And these athletes can come back and still listen to these kids heads I think we'll have a better society

Speaker 12 00:27:38.270
I think that's a beautiful note on which to close our program because it's certainly true from the intensity of the feeling that you project in his words and the things that you and others in the Hall of professionals are doing to help not only honor black old timers in sport but to convey this word of self-help and each one teach one and reach back and help their brother I'd like to thank our guest on the night soul of reason Eddie younger of the New York City Department of Recreation and The Harlem professionals It's my pleasure Dr. Brown I'm glad you invited me
