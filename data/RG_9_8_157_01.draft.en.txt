What coach once coach the Olympic track team of three nations simultaneously we're talking about the famous Joe Yancey co-founder of The New York Pioneer Club who will be honored on Sunday April 27 at the Waldorf Astoria here Joe Yancey discussed the highlights of his fabulous career on tonight's soul of reason This is Soul of reason A program that will examine the roots of the black box

Speaker 2 00:00:48.850
Soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute for American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University

Speaker 1 00:01:09.730
Our guest on this evening soul of reason is Joe Yancey a man who's known to many men in the New York area and throughout the world because of his exploits in the world of track

Speaker 3 00:01:20.920
Joe Yancey along with William called wraith and Bob Douglas co-founded the New York Pioneer Club in 1936 And over these many years the Pioneer Club and Joe Yancey in particular have done tremendous things for youth of all colors and complexions all over the world

Speaker 4 00:01:38.500
Glad to have you with us tonight Joe My pleasure ROSCOE I'm very happy to be here with you See you again Your friends have decided that it's about time to honor you and you're a man who tends to try to stay in the background But I've decided to honor you and you're going to do so on Sunday April 27 at the Waldorf Astoria hotel and people from all over the country literally from all over the world are going to come to reminisce to see you and to talk about what's happening And I imagine this must make you feel both very warm and very proud and also probably hear your settlement anxiety cause you wonder what these guys are going to say when they come in to meet you How do you really feel about this affair

Speaker 5 00:02:25.510
Well actually Roscoe it's going to be a great joy to me Very gratifying As you just mentioned I am a quiet sort of person who likes to stay in the background and all this excitement is getting tell me But I manage But it'll be a great occasion actually to see so many old friends and greet them and say hello I think it's gonna be wonderful I hope it's gonna be a real gala night

Speaker 6 00:02:58.480
Well if we run down the names of the people who've been exposed to Pioneer Club and Joe Yancey reals reads like a who's who in track world record holders people who've gone on to all types in professional positions people who've gone into show business and so on so that you have had a tremendous impact on the lives of young people So what led you and Bob Douglas and William Colby to start the Pioneer Club this is something that I've always wondered about I've known about the Pioneer Club for many many years But I wonder just what caused you fellows to get this group of people together

Speaker 7 00:03:39.040
Well back in 1936 the depression was just about ending It was a need for such a club because the other organizations I mean only had token blacks I mean it was no real integration and we thought there was a need for a club that would be open to everyone So we got I got together with my dear friend Bob Douglas and Bill Carrboro And we organized the New York Pioneer Club in the back room of the Renaissance Casino Hotel suite and some of them I think it's important to mention the legendary in his own way

Speaker 4 00:04:19.269.9999999999709
Like you Bob DOUGLAS Yes Now eighty eight

Speaker 8 00:04:23.830
Ninety two yes oh yeah

Speaker 6 00:04:26.260
I myself I had trouble keeping up and he himself was just recently honored along with the members of the original Renaissance by the old timers group And of course Bob Douglas is in the black athletes Hall of Fame and he is in the Hall of Fame of basketball because of his efforts at bringing together this group of sensational black ballplayers But the thing a lot of people don't know is what Bob Douglas has done for his community and co-founded the Pioneer Club is just another one of those kinds of things

Speaker 7 00:04:59.380
Yes definitely Bob has been very keen on amateur athletics for a number of years and mentioning the black athletes Hall of Fame I had the pleasure of accepting his award and now he's been a longtime friend and as I said before a 92 year old young and he's still going strong That wonderful character and also Bill Kolbert The other co-founder who at that time was on the staff of the athletic department at NYU your school

Speaker 4 00:05:35.560
And with the three of us I mean we got the clubs started now what essentially was your mode of operation because as long as I've heard of the Pioneer Club I've never found that you had a clubhouse at one place You sort of operated out of a find your club was all over the city How did you operate and how did you attract your performers and what type of qualification did you asked of them

Speaker 5 00:05:59.200
Well actually the pilot club was a state of mind We don't have a 20 storey clubhouse I mean we have no clubhouse excuse me except the playing field at McCall's damn park and and indoor facilities at the 316 lions Regiment Armory where we've been the guests for a number of years But our motivation has been to get these young people interested in sports to try to develop them in that particular field of endeavor and to encourage them to seek high education and through the years we've done just that

Speaker 1 00:06:40.000
I think it's beautiful that you mentioned the idea of encouraging them to seek higher education because so many of the black athletes they do not get the education that they should get

Speaker 5 00:06:51.520
And when you mentioned NYU which of course is our institution I can just see the track jerseys of people like Reggie Pearman and captain of brothers and Larry Ellis and Rudy Sam Sam Warren Halliburton white trim and can go on and on many pioneers went on to NYU and of course other universities throughout the country throughout the world for that matter You used to stock Villanova as team No not really no Well Charlie Jenkins didn't No no he came from New England He came from New York I see Oh just a man The pioneer athletes who competed for NYU you mentioned most of them but I'll mention them again Reggie Pearman one Halliburton Stanton Morris Councillor Rudy Simms Hugo and Richard Morocco Cliff Bertram and many many others that I can't think of at the moment now

Speaker 4 00:07:49.270
Cliff Bertram as you know is the present track coach at New York University and he's bringing about a renaissance and track at NYU I was talking to Cliff the other day and he said that yes something like 70 applicants who want to come to NYU both to get an education which Cliff stress just like you as number one and also to participate in track Where do you think the athletic world has gone off the track in allowing so much emphasis on competition and winning to obscure the importance of these athletes getting an education What do you think

Speaker 5 00:08:26.650
Just before I comment on that Roscoe I'd like to say how proud I am of Cliff He made a great contribution to the Pioneer Club There are a lot of fine running for the organization and he's doing a marvelous job at NYU But I think that in my opinion many individuals stress just the running and not the educational part of the college situation I've always felt and I still do that It's more important that a young man get an education along with his athletic endeavors and that's what I've stress I mean even after they've gone on to college I've still followed their career and helped them in any way that I could And the staff of the New York pilot club joined me in that endeavor

Speaker 4 00:09:22.850
Now the thing that a number of people don't know although they could have possibly guessed it just by the way the world runs is that you did all of this as a volunteer

Speaker 8 00:09:33.460
You had a full time job working for the United States government It was at the internal revenue total revenue

Speaker 4 00:09:41.260
And you're doing this eight hours a day and then putting your dinner in a brown bag and hitting the subway and going to the garden to the 60 night Regiment Armory or to the 360 9th Army or wherever it is to work with these young people and many of us have always been impressed by the esprit de corps of the Pioneer Club and there are some young men black youth in the city now who are trying to emulate this model Groups like the Adams Track Club groups like the St. Albans Athletic Club groups like the over the hill Track Club emulating the model of young men and young women coming together to run to participate but also to enjoy the fellowship and the emotional support that goes along with this In my own case as you know my name being Roscoe Brown I get confused weekly by one of your graduates I'll say that's really one of my own namesake Roscoe Lee Brown has really liked it

Speaker 5 00:10:53.760
I imagine you can tell stories on top of that as well Roscoe Lee Browne was a great athlete No question about it And he's a dear friend at the moment In fact when I was inducted into the black athletes Hall of Fame he came all from California to make the presentation and he will be here for the affair on April 27 I'd like just to say this about the Pioneer Club you mentioned I was critical That's been rather important to us in the Pioneer Club family I mean an athlete must be a gentleman first and an athlete second And we stress the development of good character We've always done that and we've we feel that our pioneers through the years have made a tremendous contribution to America not only in New York City in New York State but to America because there's that stretched out they've grown and so many pioneers are doing such a marvelous job and so many varied fashions of life today

Speaker 9 00:11:59.850
And you must be proud of the fact that as we said at the top of the show you coach the Olympic track team the three nations simultaneously in the 1956 Olympics you coach that you make team the Bahamian team and a Trinidadian team and they were all young men from these countries definitely

Speaker 3 00:12:17.430
And because of your respect and your ability you were able to coach them all in this 1956 Olympics in addition in which you have coached in Australia and coached in Tokyo and Ceylon literally all over the world and now in nineteen seventy six the Olympic track coach will be a friend of both of ours Dr. LeRoy Walker It was a graduate of New York University with HD and also a assistant chancellor at the University of North Carolina North Carolina Central DEREK Yes And this represents a long jump a tremendous amount at one time Not only were we not allowed to be trainers or coaches but you had to literally be a superstar in order to even be considered for the trials could you possibly tell our audience your reactions to these changes and why you think they came about

Speaker 10 00:13:18.240
Well in all modesty I think that came about because of the develop and the development of of athletics among all people not only black people but all people of course as you know I'm the just about the first black coach to coach an Olympic team to victory

Speaker 5 00:13:41.490
I guess I'm just about the phrase black coach to take a youth team abroad And I feel that like the name of the club the New York Pioneer Club I'm a pioneer in that endeavor And there are so many capable young people coming up today that it was just a matter of time before one of them would become the head coach of the United States Olympic team Dr. LeRoy Walker is a great great coach I mean a great man He's gonna do a fine job and I support him 100 percent as I did Stan Wright who was the assistant coach of the 1968 and 1972 United States Olympic team

Speaker 1 00:14:26.050
Now of course you've added substance to that old adage you've got to keep on keeping on That's right That's what enables any group of people to move into the mainstream of the society Continuity that really going back to this point I had raised earlier about why is it in our present athletic scene so many athletes both black and white but particularly black youth do not see the importance of education and do not get the education that they should get when they go to school on athletic scholarship What do you think has brought that about

Speaker 5 00:15:02.340
Well I really don't know Roscoe and I don't have any easy cure all for the situation It could be lack of dedication on the part of the administration in the various colleges I think that's where it lies I mean the young people don't get the proper guidance the proper support and encouragement They don't take the proper courses for graduation I mean it seems that many of them go just to play basketball or football where it's more prevalent than track and field Track or feel generally the athletes have a tendency to go all the way and graduate and get their degree

Speaker 11 00:15:50.680
Well I think part of that is what I call a function of the counter racist attitude that exists in the society that now that the white athletic establishment has found that blacks can participate and participate well they have a tendency to use them rather than to see that these black athletes like white athletes get the education that they are entitled to And I think it relates to the commercialism I think it relates to the heavy expenses for television the need to provide lots of money for athletic scholarships and somehow or another I get a feeling when I talk with you and then I talk with some of the contemporary coaches that you to live in two different worlds When you talk about education being number one and when you talk about character I mean you talk about dedication to me That's the spirit of sport And when you talk about contract and how much money you have for scholarships and how much money you're going to get for a guarantee to perform To me that smacks of business And what do you think about that Well Rosco actually

Speaker 5 00:17:00.880
This motivation for a higher education should start in the elementary school all through the high school and to college and the parents should play a part

Speaker 12 00:17:12.280
Parents and Friends they should encourage their sons and daughters I mean to obtain their degree and go on to higher education I mean I mean sports is just one facet of the American way of life I think the parents have a lot to do with it They should be more interested to see that the children have an education and be able to take their place in the mainstream of society

Speaker 4 00:17:39.310
Well that certainly is what the Pioneer Club has been about as an organization I have very definitely three men saw a need in your community now as you retire and become less active although you never retire I know that but there is a necessity of having another generation of folk to come up and continue the tradition of the Pioneer Club and I gather that it wasn't just accidental that the club was called The Pioneer Club because as you said in talking about it you saw it as a way of breaking barriers

Speaker 5 00:18:15.370
Well actually because the original name of the club was the New York Olympic club But at that time we were not allowed to use the word Olympic So we changed the name to The New York Pioneer Club because we were pine pioneering a new concept an athletic club

Speaker 12 00:18:34.120
As far as preparing for carrying on I mean I have a very capable colleague at Libby He's been with me since he was 16 years old He's a graduate of NYU he's a principal of us Intermediate School in the Bronx I have also on the staff Glenn Shain former runner who is a graduate of St. John and I have a real super athletic athlete on his staff Also Norman Tate who incidentally is a graduate of graduate robber of North Carolina Center as it was call under Dr. LeRoy Walker So we were preparing the carry on I mean not it's not a one man show by any means The staff has always been important to the advancement of the New York Pioneer Club

Speaker 4 00:19:28.090
Now for those people in the audience who are interested in the Joe Yancy testimonial dinner they should contact the Joe Yancy testimonial committee at the Statler Hilton Hotel suite 600 a correct and the affair will be on Sunday April 27 beginning at 6 o'clock And I understand that Roscoe Lee is flying in M.S. And if anyone has ever seen Roscoe M.C. Roscoe Lee at least M.S. they really have seen something I hope it's gonna be a good show I'm certain it will be Now speaking of just the pure athletic nature of your activities in the Pioneer Club what in retrospect has been your greatest thrill I do notice you mentioned winning this Olympic championship in 1952 being the first black coach to do it and that has to be very very high What really as you think about it Because when you're in sports there's so many peaks as well as a lot of valley Oh yes that you have some difficulty pulling it out but you've been in the business now for 40 some odd years What's your peak

Speaker 7 00:20:38.080
Well I've had many thrills I mean winning the 404 4 by 400 meter relay with the Jamaican Olympic team in nineteen fifty two was certainly one of them winning the national indoor championship in nineteen fifty one with another winning our first in the metropolitan championship was another great achievement and winning an outdoor metropolitan championship and also the many great relay teams that we developed through the years and the fellowship and camaraderie and the love that I get from the athletes all through the years that's been so gratifying and so wonderful that it makes it all very very worthwhile

Speaker 4 00:21:27.320
Now I've seen you on tracks rainy track Smokey track sunshiny tracks and you usually very calm regardless of what's happening The respect that you engender from your athletes is very notable Like I notice athletes are very careful about the way they use language just because of a oh well

Speaker 8 00:21:50.400
La la la la la la la la la

Speaker 11 00:21:53.770
Now how can people like you and the sense people like myself generate the type of enthusiasm and commitment on the part of black youth and those white youth who want to join us To the extent that we can maintain this tradition of people participating to do the best they can without necessarily an external reward doing it because they want to be together what can you do What are some of things that I can do What are some of the things that people in our audience can do to well develop the spirit

Speaker 5 00:22:30.910
I think it's an individual situation with me I've always had a concern for the future of our country I've always always been very ready to sit and people all around the world It's been a pleasure to talk with people break bread with them et cetera I feel that you have to have it within you it has to be within you that you're willing to make this contribution to life and you do it freely openly and and you do without thought of any compensation

Speaker 13 00:23:05.680
I mean it's just a a beautiful feeling that it gives you that you know that you are doing something and I feel like my greatest satisfaction has been that to the extent that I've been able to make this small contribution to a better way of life for all of us through athletics and race relations

Speaker 4 00:23:27.580
See you one of those quiet revolutionaries and some of the younger people are more overt about this in a sense you're saying in your own personal commitment your own personal drive leads you to feel this way Right

Speaker 11 00:23:43.720
On the other hand you might look at it another way and that is that if black people as a group in our society are going to advance and and keep the advances that they've made that they're going to have to give more service to their own community well and service should become a byword in the activities of every black citizen

Speaker 1 00:24:06.640
It doesn't have to be as head coach but it can be some kind of service in your block in your community in your church And I wouldn't suggest this is a cliché because it is easily used as a cliché but I think the yoga answers of the well highlight this And in your own way through your efforts and through the publicity the testimonial is giving you and your efforts We're engendering this this message which is really larger than Joe Yancey and that is the message that those of us in the black community who have talents must serve the black community and of course the world at large But essentially we have to deal with our own

Speaker 8 00:24:47.890
Is that a philosophy that really comes behind it Or have you really been so busy that you have it Well I have time I really haven't thought about it

Speaker 13 00:24:57.550
I just got into this situation and because of my great desire to help people help young people and that's been my dedication I mean it's nothing else I have no axe to grind and as I mentioned before you know I'm gainfully employed at the Internal Revenue Service

Speaker 8 00:25:23.360
So you certainly are gainfully at this time of year

Speaker 9 00:25:29.080
Perfect

Speaker 4 00:25:30.670
Let me ask another question which doesn't directly relate to the Pioneer Club but it does relate to track and athletics

Speaker 11 00:25:37.990
It has been suggested by some that the emphasis on competition between countries between nations in the Olympics is a negative force that the athletes really should come together regardless of national affiliation and not wear national colors and not have the national anthem play it etc. How do you feel about that

Speaker 13 00:25:59.320
Well I don't agree with that I've participated in six Olympic Games and I feel that they're not completely correct the way they're organized but I think they do a marvelous job and they do a great job I've been in the Olympic village for these five or six Olympic Games and I've seen the way the young people get together the camaraderie the friendship their fellowship and how well they get on And I think that they do a great job They make friends with each other And I think the Olympic movement with a few corrections here and there is a great movement and we'll survive I think so

Speaker 1 00:26:48.130
I think it's with the spirit of people like Joe Yancey that is going to survive if we are able to deal with some of these excesses I'd like to mention to our audience that those who are interested in participating in the salute to Joe Yancey should contact the Joe Yancey testimonial committee at the Statler Hilton Hotel suite 600 a or else call 2 4 4 5 8 4 0 that's 2 4 4 5 8 4 4 0 4 information about the Joe Yancey testimonial I understand a very charming young lady Joan Kay Harris is coordinating this and you have a very auspicious committee that's all types of folks who work with you Lorenzo Buck Herb Douglas Meredith Claudine Ed Mosley Stan Andy Stanfield and William Blakely who've been working on this and it really should be a fantastic success as you I hope so As you look to the future what do you really hope happens as a result of the activities of the Pioneer Club

Speaker 13 00:27:54.040
Well I hope that the Pioneer Club can continue to go from strength to strength and carry on doing the job that we've been doing for the upwards of thirty nine years in the field of amateur athletics and race relations

Speaker 4 00:28:08.920
That's a beautiful way on which to close our show Thanks to Joe Yancey for being our guest on tonight soul of reason And thank you very much Roscoe
