Speaker 3 00:00:38.280
This is Soul of reason a program that will examine the roots of the black box soul of reason is produced by the NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University

Speaker 1 00:01:05.220
Our guest on tonight soul of reason is Dr. Herbert White who is with the New York City Department of Personnel and has a very responsible position dealing with selection of the personnel in New York City Good to have you with us tonight herb

Speaker 4 00:01:18.870
Thank you Glad to be back with you Roscoe

Speaker 1 00:01:21.880
Well let's just get right into the question that we raised at the beginning of the show The reason cutbacks in New York City has had an adverse impact on minority employees What is really the nature of the impact you have in statistics on this and also some observations about some of the implications of these cutbacks

Speaker 4 00:01:44.400
Well Roscoe the statistics I think were rather dramatically put forward by the Commissioner of Human Rights Eleanor Holmes Norton last week on the front pages of The Times in which it is This means that it is now recognized rather openly that the cutbacks have just about abolished whatever advances might have been made within the last seven or eight years in minority group employment in New York City with those advances we were not very far we were still at a very low rate of participation of blacks and Puerto Ricans and the police force fire force Management Budget Bureau Department of Personnel and occupational groups such as personnel

Speaker 1 00:02:47.560
Examiner Well in other words what you're really saying situation was bad that the these cutbacks have affected blacks and Puerto Ricans mainly in certain departments where they were already sort of last hired and therefore the first to be let go because I believe and you can correct me on this is that in certain of the low title positions there's a fairly large number of minority throughout the New York City civil service not just any one particular department for example department hospitals which is not civil service but that's a new york city position a Welfare Department and others

Speaker 5 00:03:28.560
What is the what was before these cutbacks the approximate overall proportion of blacks and other minorities in New York city's civil service

Speaker 6 00:03:39.360
I I can't give you the exact statistics on that

Speaker 4 00:03:45.630
I can give you the run approximation of it being about 25 percent of city service consisted of minority group members

Speaker 7 00:03:58.200
This 25 percent as you imply the were in the entry level and lower level titles such as clerk dietary aid in some cases an entry level title for example in HDI core community liaisons aid or community service worker titles which had been had been created within the last six years or so and primarily under the Lindsay administration to deal with the community There had been quite a number of blacks who had come into these titles recently The layoff or a layoff Has affected those individuals disastrously We can say that the situation before was bad in the sense that in the sense that there was overall in significant titles a low minority percentage participation Now the situation is disastrous

Speaker 8 00:05:11.830
All right

Speaker 7 00:05:12.650
Given that perhaps could I perhaps I could turn or turn the situation a little better around and compare that with the police department or the fire department the police department and the fire department always had low participation by minority group members partly because of the adverse picture of minority groups in the in the community the methods of investigation that had been used by previous administrations when it came to minority group members the two value system of investigation the image of the police department in the black community and a number of other factors the kinds of examinations that were given a number of these factors had resulted in very very low minority group participation in the police department And two years ago there was a huge recruitment campaign to attempt to correct the condition without making any value judgment on the recruitment campaign It was a it was to some extent successful there had been a turnaround in the attitude toward the minority group community and for the first time the city was saying quite frankly we want black policemen and we want Puerto Rican policemen While there was very little minority group input into decision making on recruitment methods and test construction in this particular campaign we did get I think some small increase in minority group participation in the police department

Speaker 9 00:07:01.550
Those results have been totally abolished with the layoffs

Speaker 5 00:07:07.460
This is all right now given that that is a fact and probably the number of people in these various job titles is not going to increase over the next few years What can be done in this whole area of getting more minorities into civil service or are you really saying that we have reached an impasse and at the present time other than upward mobility for those who remain in the system we're not really going to see more minorities coming into New York city's civil service

Speaker 10 00:07:42.710
We're not going to see more minority group members coming in to New York city's civil service unless a very drastic change takes place

Speaker 9 00:07:54.480
JEFF Well first of all the budgetary crisis presents a I would not say the rationale but the budgetary crisis presents the rationale for Lay And as we know the the exit of minority group members is very difficult to provide a budgetary rationale for the entrance

Speaker 10 00:08:29.210
We can say that the Equal Employment Opportunity program asks that more minority groups be employed and represented in this is the position of the black civil service organizations and my own organization

Speaker 7 00:08:46.820
Pier but this is a argument that is presented on the basis of morality fairness and the what should be well This does not have any effect Yeah well that's true

Speaker 11 00:09:02.330
On the other hand you do have sort of two clashing causes One is a course that deals with personnel shrinkage because of the budgetary crisis and the other cause that the court and other agencies are saying that governmental units and businesses should have affirmative action programs should try to be non-discriminatory or are the court going to interpret that as non-discriminatory in the light of whatever jobs are available

Speaker 12 00:09:31.460
According to Eleanor Holmes Norton most of the court cases which have attracted the attack the seniority principle have failed

Speaker 13 00:09:43.370
And other delays that are getting to seniority as a whole is that of a buy right that holds up

Speaker 11 00:09:50.240
All right well let's turn to another area that if we've seniority principle is going to hold up What about area of promotion because still there will be because retirements etc. some upward mobility and for those blacks and Hispanics who remain there is still the need to have fair examinations and to see to it that blacks get moved into higher positions Is there anything that's being done in an organized way in department of personnel to see to it that minorities get a better shot at promotions than they have in the past

Speaker 12 00:10:31.710
I can say that I do not feel that there is anything that is directly being done throughout the city to promote the interests of minority groups in terms of advancement Not directly Well I know more such things as an increased emphasis on research and tests validity which would help to cancel Which would help to cancel out possibly the difference in test performance The emphasis on job related tests which are to the advantage of minority group members there is within the department of personnel an increased emphasis on training throughout the entire department I cannot see anything that is happening that will have any differential effect however generally in increasing the opportunities for minority group members The system is too vast for that too for that effect to be felt and the general trend now is simply to save it White will say simply it is to save jobs All right

Speaker 11 00:11:56.590
The playoffs begin of jobs at one time there was a thrust on the part of the black civil service workers organization to have a black person appointed to one of the high level positions director assistant director in the department of personnel and I believe that that effort has not borne fruit at present What is the status of that effort

Speaker 6 00:12:18.570
Let me precede that by saying that I believe that the only hope that the blacks and Puerto Ricans have in civil service is to have an effective organization that presses for their needs in pressing for such needs Black civil service workers can always have the sense that ultimately they are or that ultimately they are reflecting not only their own interests but the interests of all civil service workers because the kinds of things that the black civil service workers ask for are increased training opportunities They ask for this not only for themselves but for all civil service workers because very little training really exists in city departments The budgetary allow allowance for that is very small They ask for improved personnel systems The general program upon which black civil service work stands is one really of a first class personnel administration and that will guarantee opportunities and rights to everyone

Speaker 13 00:13:33.500
Oh wow How did that happen

Speaker 12 00:13:36.160
OK Now on that basis it was the Federation of Negro Civil Service Organizations and peer the organization which personnel employees for equal equal rights of which I am the president at the Department of Personnel pressed to have a personnel director selected who was very very highly qualified as a psychologist and as a personnel person

Speaker 14 00:14:20.910
Well what happened in this crusade to get a black in the highest level of the department of personnel

Speaker 12 00:14:28.110
We enlisted the support of the 100 Black Men

Speaker 13 00:14:36.700
Mark could you explain to our audience what 100 Black Men and what Mark are Because those are organization not everyone is female

Speaker 15 00:14:43.680
Well Mark is a An organizer a research action research organization that was headed by Dr. Clarke at the time who was very interested in

Speaker 6 00:15:00.150
Promoting an understanding of how groups could obtain socially desirable objectives And considering this a social socially desirable objective why he worked quite closely with us and giving us a vice established the connections with the 100 Black Men and a few other organizations in the community

Speaker 10 00:15:40.630
The 100 Black Men is an organization of outstanding black businessmen politicians and professional people in the community who have banded together to express and implement aspirations of the black community a very strong position was taken in support of the individual that we advanced as a personnel director

Speaker 15 00:16:15.040
A committee was set up by the mayor to look and examined a look at an exam and examine the qualifications of the individuals advanced After three or four months in which we got I think some coverage in the Amsterdam News and in the New York Age The decision came out and the person who is a deputy personnel director was selected We realized at the time that it was almost almost an impossible task to try to convince the other major city politicians that a at the time was ripe for a here black personnel director but we we we we felt that it would be worthwhile to make the fight to put all of our energies into this There was a chance of success which we had one of the most remarkable people in in the community advanced what somebody would published about 15 books was an airforce hero was a university professor It was recognized by everyone as as having the ability for the job And our expectation was that if we did lose we at least would have made the advance of bringing to the attention that the necessity for the participation in decision making in the city on personnel matters by blacks and Puerto Ricans Well I know there would be some spillover into other areas

Speaker 11 00:18:03.640
I know that there are some very competent people in the department such as yourself and there are other high level positions I believe you have a an important responsibility right now which we'll talk about a little later but what about the deputy directorship of personnel Is that filled by a minority or is any potential of that being filled by a minority person

Speaker 6 00:18:26.530
Well no I answer directly No because the situation has been resolved There was an attempt to convince the mayor and city politicians I suppose or whoever the people are that the side appointments There was an attempt to convince them that I should be the deputy personnel director I believe about eight organizations or so supported this The Federation of Negro Civil Service Organizations first did initiated at the end branches of the NAACP supported it sending letters to the mayor's office the Association of Black South social workers a number of organizations didn't work out I did not work out right

Speaker 13 00:19:20.670
While I was on vacation Deputy personnel director was appointed

Speaker 11 00:19:25.600
Well let's talk about your present responsibility and I believe you had a program known as the rep program and you also have recently received a grant from the intergovernmental Personnel Act program Could you tell us exactly what you're doing there and how this relates to improving job opportunities for minorities

Speaker 6 00:19:44.720
The the program the rep program has a title that I think none of us like It's called The Work Relief employment program It however had magnificent potential for helping those minority group members who are on relief What was done was to create titles in civil service temporary titles in civil service which directly parallel the jobs existing and civil service for example a title in rap such as office aid officer Assistant rap paralleled in the title of clerk in civil service The intent here was to build up a kind of a system that would reproduce in in most aspects a civil service system The employees were given sick leave They were given the same pay as civil service employees It was designed to lift the morale increase the initiative and the skills of people who participated in the day to move on

Speaker 5 00:21:03.670
These were people who were on welfare

Speaker 16 00:21:05.230
These were people who were on welfare We had 11000 at one What has happened to that program That program has declined to approximately fifteen hundred people now Why is that Because the U I guess 1 1 1 Fact is the budgetary crisis We can put it that way The budgetary crisis both state and city has resulted in what ostensibly is a decision that any money put into a program like this is excess course costs more than relief and that therefore it is necessary to fall back on the ordinary dole system

Speaker 5 00:21:49.450
By no dole system in other words instead of their working and getting money that pay them more than the basic welfare check now they're not most of these people are not working and are getting the basic welfare check

Speaker 16 00:22:00.880
That would be a first they would go onto unemployment insurance and then back onto welfare Those people who are terminated

Speaker 17 00:22:08.020
I think there's one very important point that should be seen here and this is that the moneys that previously were going into welfare checks That very same money which went into welfare checks was put into a fun And instead of going into welfare checks was going into salaries to provide people with a meaningful work experience a Research a research that was done in Housing and Development Administration showed that even among those employees who were suddenly left go last summer that 99 percent of them felt that their experience in the program was profitable and that although they resented the sudden cut off of the program for them since they had been a sudden decision by the state that 18 months was the maximum and that anyone could remain at it We had 13 Hunt 100 people laid off Within I would say two or three weeks that those people who were very resentful because of this kind of a sudden sudden layoff that those very same people in their responses ex stated that they thought that the program had done them a tremendous amount of good and that they were they they wished that they could continue with it and they directly contact contradicted some of the

Speaker 14 00:23:32.640
The picture which I was going to retire by those who aren't Yes I right All right Well I was one of the question comes up with that Even with a program like this with the funding eventually even at the crisis the funding is gonna run out Was there an intention that these people would be transferred to regular civil service jobs after the rep program ran out

Speaker 18 00:23:52.990
Well the when the program was originally constructed there was no 18 month the term there was no 18 month limitation but largely it alone would dictate it couldn't go on forever and go on Well the point that I'd like to make is that so long as relief funds went on go on such a program can go on because it really funds instead of being given out as a Dole can be converted into jobs and that's what is what happened here

Speaker 14 00:24:17.560
It's the first time it's ever been done well and where the jobs are meaningful well-paying jobs jobs which have skills on the other hand I believe that the legislation even if federal legislation did have a cutoff period on it and a question I'm raising as to whether or not this program might not have been a good way to get more blacks into permanent civil service jobs it definitely would have been

Speaker 18 00:24:43.270
It definitely would have been with the In normal times without the tremendous layoffs and civil service that there are now All right Oh good way to build up a skills for going into private industry in these two directions had been established

Speaker 11 00:24:59.410
All right well Peter tell us about your project under the intergovernmental Personnel Act which is a very interesting project you working on now the population such as rap

Speaker 8 00:25:13.930
Tell us what the project is directly Okay It is to do test research on the rat population to attempt to construct valid tests and to eliminate the testing bias And what are you doing in order to achieve that objective

Speaker 18 00:25:29.920
What we have what we're doing a job analysis of rep jobs we're giving experimental tests to rep people and we're we are finding out whether there is any connection between performance on the tests and on and job performance In other words are those who perform well on the job also perform well on the test

Speaker 5 00:25:55.540
Well given the fact that most of Europe people have gone Oh what kind of population do you have to work with

Speaker 18 00:26:01.040
We we have asked when we have got an extension of the grant to the seat to population

Speaker 19 00:26:09.090
It's a what is the liability of money bureaucrats They always use alphabet soup but what is an alphabet soup is what is the theatre population That's something I'm really sorry Sorry to be guilty because I condemn it and other people they see a seat there is a comprehensive Employment and Training Act

Speaker 18 00:26:27.290
It's the one under which people who are unemployed are put in temporary civil service jobs The money is provided by the federal government There was a recent controversy over this as to whether city employees could be could be hired the laid off city employees could be hired on the CTA and that was resolved by a court case and they are being hired to see if they are being hired which sort of undercuts the basic purpose of cedar which was to bring in minorities and other people who are unemployed

Speaker 13 00:27:03.140
However it must be said that if laid off city employees are not working they also employ many of the laid off city employees Mean Goodman though it does work out although I do know that there was quite a a conflict

Speaker 14 00:27:14.600
Well as we come toward the close of our program tonight could you give out in sort of a long range view as you see it as to the future of selection procedures for minorities and civil service

Speaker 18 00:27:27.500
Well I believe that the only course that will really guarantee any advances for a minority group members now is a very very strong organizational approach You mean a political pro political right a political and civil service organizational approach to impress upon a Structure that makes decisions that minority group members wish to practice participate meaningfully in in areas where minority group destinies are affected

Speaker 14 00:28:16.670
I think with a person like Herb white helping out within the department of personnel certainly some of those things might happen Our guest on tonight soul of reason has been Dr. Herbert White who's with the New York City Department a personality associate personal Examiner and we've been talking about the impact of cuts in New York City's budget on minority civil service workers Glad to have had you with the guest tonight on tonight celebrate Thank you very much Russell
