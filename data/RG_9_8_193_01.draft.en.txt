On May 22nd 1975 New York City's bicentennial celebration was officially opened by a mayor beam J Clarence Davis chairman of the board of The New York City bicentennial corporation and Dr. Ryan Woodrow executive vice president of the corporation Since then many school and community projects have been initiated here Allan Dempsey Robert Williams of the Bicentennial corporation and Florence Jackson of The New York City Board of Education discussed these programs on tonight's soul of This is Soul of reason a program that will examine the roots of the black box

Speaker 2 00:00:57.710
Soul of reason is produced by the WNBA Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University

Speaker 3 00:01:18.380
With us this evening on solar reason Ellen Dempsey who's director of educational programs for the New York City bicentennial corporation Robert Williams who is director of community programs for the New York City bicentennial corporation and Florence Jackson who is director of social studies for the New York City Board of Education

Speaker 4 00:01:36.260
Glad to have you folks with us tonight And we have a lot to talk about So let's just begin by talking about what's going to happen in New York City to celebrate the 200 anniversary of our country's founding Ellen you work an educational program and briefly you throw out a couple of ideas and then we'll go on to Bob and Florence

Speaker 5 00:01:55.820
Well we of course as you mentioned on May 22nd the city began its program and the schools in New York City got involved by 10 days of festivities celebrations exhibits et cetera to show the kinds of things that they'd been doing during the year coming and every school for example is being involved in a major program area called documentation where they write their own ethnic and community histories and what we've developed is the materials that tell them how to do it

Speaker 3 00:02:28.600
I mean you're gonna have several hundred and some odd ethnic and community histories We certainly hope so We certainly hope so All right Now Bob what about the community particularly the minority communities because there are many of us who are minorities who don't feel that there's anything to celebrate in terms of the bicentennial

Speaker 6 00:02:45.290
We've been oppressed for 300 years And why should we be involved in this And I'm sure as a director of community programs which includes not only in minority communities but many many ethnic communities of white background you have to answer this question So what's going on there

Speaker 7 00:03:02.050
Roscoe the general attitude is away from the whole you know attitude of assimilation and melting pot in New York City Now people are concerned about the pluralistic development of our country and our city And in that regard all of the ethnic groups particularly the blacks have tried to focus in on certain focal points like Harlem will celebrate the bicentennial in its own way You know they have chosen two specific dates New Year's and the Fourth of July to really make the expression of what you know the black contributions have been We have a subcommittee in the corporation which has been developed to demonstrate 200 years of black participation and evolution and focus on blacks in New York during the revolution and pre revolution And there are many self-help efforts with blacks and whites working together in communities in Queens particularly in Laurel town up in Northeast Browns where they had instant museums either These are programs in some museum program incidentally is a program which really helps you explore your ethnic roots It's a program where you asked everybody in the community you participate through the schools you send literature home etc. to the parents the people we actually will bring the oldest artifact in the House and to tell the story about that artifact and what we find is that there are multi-ethnic communities all over New York City and mass birth when we did it we thought it was a Polish community we found six ethnic groups in mass math that were all well rooted and generations of people in mass But so to characterize the bicentennial from a community point of view basically it is self-help projects projects that are to uplift the community or community awareness or just cleanliness in the community like cleanup programs etc. And generally people in New York City want to express their sentiment about the bicentennial in their own way They don't want citywide programs by and large I found from a community point of view

Speaker 3 00:05:01.430
Well of course I know the bicentennial Corporation has this threefold approach and Heritage Festival and horizons Yes And basically you're moving from the heritage which is examination of roots into the festival Of course it's a festival that's causing the greatest amount of controversy because whereas the great American dream the Great American Experiment at Franklin and Jefferson it really hadn't worked out too well And Florence as a director of social studies this is right up your alley

Speaker 8 00:05:35.450
And being with the establishment you can't really completely say or encourage kids just to take up this country On the other hand in good conscience you can't just have them going around patting the country on the back and say you know in this wonderful and also repeating all of lies about Franklin and Washington and Jefferson because they were human beings and what's written Social studies books really that make a lot of sense in most instances So how you're dealing with this now that's a big question

Speaker 9 00:06:05.030
But let me back up a little bit and I think come up to your question First of all you mentioned Ellen from the corporation working on education programs And I'd like to say that Ellen and I have been working together This is our third school year in terms of planning programs education programs for the schools as well as the community cooperation with Bill up here But at the same time some of our ideas were geared to the whole idea of documentation which Ellen mentioned in that each child in a sense has an opportunity to look for his or her particular roots And we thought by giving him opportunities to do research in their own neighborhoods they can begin to see that what is now called the United States was also a pluralistic society Way back in the beginnings we tend to feel of course that most of our beginnings are from western civilization But I think in doing the research youngsters are beginning to find that people from other parts of the world we're also here at that time they will find particularly in the black communities that there were many black people here for a number of reasons of course back in the seventeen hundreds and were brought because of the economic situation and for economic reasons

Speaker 10 00:07:30.650
But a nice euphemistic way of saying that they were stolen from their shores and brought here to some of the most oppressive conditions that mankind has ever faced And that's exactly what I'm talking about

Speaker 11 00:07:40.160
Well we want youngsters to know this We want them to know this and not feel that they were brought here for very good reasons But at the same time we want youngsters to know that during the Revolutionary period that they were free blacks who were contributing to the development of this country And in this way they can now relook at history or look at it in a different way and see that they too have a stake have contributed all through the years it may have been through the sweat of their brows that may have been done in a way that black people did not always receive the recognition for what they have done But we want kids to see this and understand that they too have a reason to celebrate the two hundredth anniversary of the country because many of their forbearers also participated in making it a free country because that's a euphemism too

Speaker 12 00:08:35.710.0000000000582
Well yeah we can go on free as well OK

Speaker 6 00:08:39.80.00000000005821
And I realize sometime I'm serious and I'm not I'm being a little facetious but I realize that we do throw around these words like freedom and democracy and particularly we do it in schools which is what so embittered so many youngsters when they grow up and they find that what they allegedly are involved in a so-called free country isn't really free and there's tremendous amount of racism and oppression Which leads me to this question right How are you going to handle things like the three fifths of a man compromise in the constitutional convention where slavery was extended for 20 years by these so-called Founding Fathers and where slaves were actually count as three fifths of a man And that's something and I think that every kid white black Hispanic et cetera ought to know and should be taken as a challenge rather than something we should celebrate

Speaker 11 00:09:33.350
Well I think that youngsters should be allowed to examine these issues and realize that racism existed then and exists today in many different forms I guess more subtly than it did then But another part of our educational program is to have youngsters for example examine some a present day issues There was another program which I know Ellen was going to get to and that is the Committees of Correspondence where high school youngsters have several issues that they will be dealing with You know like the family like ethnic studies and other present day problems that exist around the country they'll have an opportunity to do some research examine them and share their ideas with youngsters and other parts of the country

Speaker 6 00:10:17.900
Well then well Ellen maybe you could pick up on that because that seems like that's going into the horizon phase and we said the Heritage phase is looking back The festival the celebration and the horizon is what do we do about these problems that remain for the next hundred years of the next 200 years so maybe you could pick up from Florence and tell us a little bit more about that project How many schools are involved how many cities are involved When do you expect it to take place in so on

Speaker 5 00:10:44.810
Well I think in this area there are two projects that are very serious projects dealing with the future One is the committee's correspondents and the other is a project called bicentennial scholar and the committees of correspondence is a matching city project with New York City as the hub of the whole thing And there at the moment 25 high schools in New York City will be corresponding on major issues with because the schools around the country are generally much smaller It is generally matched on a one to two basis so we are approximately 50 high schools anywhere from an Indian reservation to a city like Los Angeles who will be corresponding with students in New York and then dealing with major issues and coming up with a declaration of aspirations at the end which deals with changes for the future and the bicentennial Scholar program is being coordinated among a consortium of colleges and universities in New York with if ITV and a host school and what they will do that is using social studies American Studies 11th grade curriculum and serious American issues developed by the National Endowment for the Humanities develop a series of meetings consortiums etc. For this bicentennial scholar students and that again will let the voices of the students be heard and what they really think

Speaker 6 00:12:06.150
Will these bicentennial scholars be high school students or college students their 11th grade high school students But you said it ties in with F. I T which is yes

Speaker 5 00:12:15.030
Why is it that the colleges in their 50s the high school are going to give their faculty and staff time to actually work with the students at these workshops And what will come out of the workshop Lee There will be proceedings will be published regularly and then I cannot take it back to their schools and then finally at the end again they will be able to talk about their ideas for the future and aspirations etc. Well Bob and community programs I have heard you talk before about this declaration of aspirations

Speaker 6 00:12:48.730
When is it coming down July 4th nineteen seventy seven on July 4th 1976 and what inputs are the community is going to have into this

Speaker 7 00:13:01.900
Well there are two projects asking what is a what we call our town meeting series and the other is the American Issues Forum and we have invited the New York City communities to participate in both of those programs The issues forum is a program which is uniform topics that have been designed to generate a national dialogue I have taken it to many of the communities and very frankly the community did not want to be bothered with it because they felt that the topics were very very bland did not really address itself to the problems that currently face people in communities in New York City and New York City now is becoming more neighborhood oriented and community control oriented than ever before past you know the whole aspect of decentralization and community control etc.

Speaker 6 00:13:49.480
So therefore what this means is the communities really have to get down and develop their own declaration of aspiration absolutely through a series of town meetings Now Bob what will happen in these town meetings when will their deliberations be reported

Speaker 13 00:14:04.990
Well there are a series Some communities have undertaken to do a series of town meetings ask whether they're going to do one out in Far Rockaway on October 28 that's the next one not to Floyd Bennett Field What they are doing basically is recording the dialogue addressing issues that are germane to that particular community or that particular burrow and they will come up with what we call a declaration of aspirations from the Community Planning Boards which you know some of some of the products will have capital implications and that is the route that you take you know in terms of into government when you talk about technology's aspiration and talk about something as simple as getting the streets clean

Speaker 6 00:14:43.420
It could be an adequate class size and a few other things that are necessary Are you going to talk about larger things like full employment elimination of sexism elimination racism how is it going to take what forms are going to

Speaker 14 00:14:57.710
I think you know if Roscoe Brown was in the audience in his community he would raise those topics and many people are you know thinking seriously like that you know and you know I see college professors in these town meetings and they raise these questions ask you know the one in Rockaway they were talking about building an airport in the Atlantic you know as the answer to the s t etc. You know very serious problem that's a 15 billion dollar project that they like to undertake in Queens You know as to things as minimal as just cleaning up a vast pocket park or you know ideas as exciting as urban recycling or in Harlem they are concerned about having more black cops in Harlem and I've seen you know Sir Basil Patterson conducting meetings up in Harlem on that specific issue with militants etc. All these things Oh come under the topic of you know bicentennial town meeting because they're using the bicentennial as a catalyst That's all

Speaker 6 00:15:57.990
All right because they're a lot of things in New York to be a catalyst including our present financial crisis And I know your own cooperation has gone through some of those trials and tribulations like the Board of Education and every other unit here Now what's going to happen out of these town meetings I must admit that they aren't attended by tens of thousands of people that therefore they are going to be really the thoughts of some very interested involved people Now what's going to happen is they're finally is gonna be presented as a declaration of aspiration Yes When is it going to happen What's the form and so on

Speaker 7 00:16:33.880
Well the plan right now is to present the declaration of aspirations or the declarations of absolute aspiration to the mayor on July 4th 1976 as an indication of the direction that the various communities around New York City would like to go in the next 50 100 years

Speaker 6 00:16:51.250
Is there going to be any publication of these so that other people can know what other groups came up with

Speaker 14 00:16:57.180
Well on the and the educational programs I'm sure there will be at present You know right now it's supposed to be in the form of a scroll the Lord scrolled presentation to the mayor but this will be a document that will certainly be an archival record for the future

Speaker 6 00:17:12.200
Of course I'm sure you wanted to be more than archival record and one of the questions I would have if I were a participant is what's going to happen

Speaker 10 00:17:18.609.9999999998836
OK Is this going to go in the mayor's drawer Is it going to be on television and then roll up for the next hundred years

Speaker 14 00:17:25.359.9999999998836
Well and I realize that's not in your purview but still it's a reasonable question that certainly like many city plans you know that that is the origin and the terminus of those plans But in this case the whole implication was there was that of intergovernmental liaison coordination etc. When you talk about a win with neighborhood association which got a bicentennial grant from the State Council on the arts of ten or fifteen thousand dollars to do an urban recycling study and this is one that will you know address itself to noise abatement from the train that you know the train that runs on Jamaica Avenue down to how they will deal with beautifying the walls or having a certain color on the avenue itself you know which is coordinated with the businessmen etc. Now the question is fine This plan will be done this fifteen thousand dollars for this plan What is the follow up I've attended a number of meetings with at this moment You know assistant commissioners etc. from city planning What is the master plan from Department of Sanitation police waterworks etc. to let them know that fifteen miles is coming into the community The community planning boards is a mechanism which through which many of these capital improvements are developed they are there You know the councilmen are there The elected officials are there and they're trying to coordinate the right hand know with the left hand is doing I think it's a perfect opportunity for some cohesiveness in planning through local community people who look to their elected official and city agencies to deliver certain things and I think in the case of Wynwood Neighborhood Association and the Woodside community it's a giant step forward and I think that we will see you know a perfect example of urban recycling through that project

Speaker 3 00:19:06.500
Okay Seeming on solar reason why you're talking with Bob Williams who's Director of Community Affairs Allen Dempsey who's director of educational program at the New York City bicentennial corporation and Florence Jackson is director of social studies of New York City Board of Education and Florence I'd like to ask you the question as to what the Board of Education really shouldn't say the board of education which is a what your department is doing in this bicentennial celebration study and evaluation to sort of set the record straight about blacks in the revolution a number of people just don't know that there were any blacks involved in revolution at all either as soldiers or as political figures or as free people

Speaker 6 00:19:52.630
What are you doing to set that record straight Because I know how difficult it is to tell teachers what to teach But I also know you can influence them in a variety of ways

Speaker 9 00:20:01.540
Well we've done a number of things First of all we have developed in cooperation with the New York City bicentennial Corporation a handbook for teachers on the Bicentennial and this handbook gives specific directions on how to help youngsters do research of their communities We had talk some time before about through the investigation of communities you could find your backgrounds and what your particular ethnic group has done in the past and how it relates to the revolution Well this handbook for teachers gives places to find information How do you help youngsters do such a research where they may go for additional assistance et cetera It's filled with that in addition to that we have sent out to all schools a list of materials for ethnic group for many different ethnic groups not only black around the city that are library books that youngsters can find information So what we've done is called the names of all of these particular books and we've sent them out to the schools Another project is that we've developed curriculum materials which has done some of the research in terms of blacks and in terms of Puerto Ricans that we have now available and have sent that out to the schools so that there's a variety of things directions on how to do it lists of materials

Speaker 6 00:21:22.520
I mentioned books I should have included film strips and films that kind of audio visual materials plus curriculum materials and I would assume since you're doing such a fantastic job at every student in New York City would know that Crispus Attucks was a black man was the first man to die in defense of his country in this fight for liberty Now to what extent and I know that isn't true because every day I run into people including teachers who don't know the Crispus Attucks was the first person to die in the fight for freedom Now what can we do about that It seems to me that the type of thing is so important in breaking down the racism that exists in our society that we really need to reinforce that I have a feeling sometimes when you let people just wander around the side what they're going to teach they teach things that influence that reflect their own biases And I think there's certain key things that we really need to deal with For example I don't know how much this comes across but to a large extent the American Revolution was a revolution of property holders and people who want to make things better for themselves Now maybe that's a little too cold to throw on to a third grader or a fourth grader but I don't think letting them know that Crispus Attucks was a black man a freshman that line fence for this country is too cold Now what do you do about that

Speaker 9 00:22:45.860
What do we Well we are doing a really exactly what I mentioned to you and the fact that we're sending the materials directly to the schools first attics and these material Yes you most definitely shouldn't be right in the list Now when I mentioned curriculum materials this is teaching materials and information about blacks Most of it in New York City but around the country and then we extend even around the world I mean it broadens out but in terms of the revolution historical materials are included in the curriculum materials that are sent to the schools and we look at our curriculum bulletins as a sort of a teacher training manual at the same time It gives the information plus what to do with it in the manual so that the teacher if he or she does not have the background gets this information in the material that is sent to them to teach the youngsters in this way we hope to meet the needs of many many many more people You know we have over 50000 teachers to deal with and educate a million pupils to do

Speaker 8 00:23:46.790
Now Ellen in your capacity as director of educational programs I assume whereas you work with foreigners and you actually believe education and other kinds of education other than takes place in public schools or private schools there are other kinds of things of an educational nature things in museums things and colleges things and lecture groups and the like is your program encompass to deal with that particular phase of education as well are you more or less limited to working with the public schools

Speaker 15 00:24:18.540
One one the concepts behind this whole program was having actually a Board of Education person which is myself working with other people at the bicentennial corporation so that we link up with museums and cultural groups et cetera and for example we have a project in colonial and ethnic crafts I mean taught at the Metropolitan Museum for teachers but with an historical perspective to these crafts as well so that we have different groups lending a hand to get this kind of thing done with the schools We even have event kinds of things that are sometimes really under the festival fun area such as something that's coming up called the Ben Franklin kite event and an event like that we get groups together like the Bureau of art music and dance groups in Central Park PRCA and the kids learning something about something like kite making and doing a little historical research Kids have to be designed around something in American symbols And again it's it's a learning process and it also has many outside groups involved

Speaker 16 00:25:30.260
Many of the colleges involved in doing anything because it's certainly true that colleges probably teach a great deal of what's involved in Bicentennial history this is a normal part of the curriculum Are there any things that colleges are doing particularly to highlight the bicentennial

Speaker 5 00:25:46.580
Well the bicentennial scholars program that we spoke that before is really something that they are doing in conjunction with you with each other but to work with high school students but they learn in a certain kind of expertise that we would need to have a very serious scholarly program and by the way that program doesn't end in the school year in June 76 I see it as an ongoing thing and chose 11th grade students who were American studies and then going to economics so that they could go through another year until June of 77

Speaker 16 00:26:21.750
Now Bob as director community programs you've certainly heard this question well the bicentennial is going to be one big whoop de doo and it's going to end on July 4th of 1976 and all the great things that we've been doing and we're talking about it just going to sort of fade away What are you doing in cooperation to keep that from happening recognizing that the corporation itself would probably fade away but hopefully some of these great things that you're doing in terms of creation of ethnic awareness knowledge of the community declaration of aspirations won't fade away So what are some of the things you're doing to sort of ensure at least that some of these things will continue

Speaker 7 00:27:01.160
Well I suppose the word is a self-destruct That's what the corporation will do in 1977 But the plan certainly will not For example the INS the museums There is a a art exhibit that is planned and the artist Earl Sweeting is going to do 10 pictures portraying the fact that blacks have died from Christmas addicts and have died in every war that this country has fought And he will have you know the woman who registered in the army is Robert Sherrill off etc. that depicted these things will be donated to the somber collection Many of the ensuing museums will be kept together either in pictorial form or in its original form and rotated through communities etc. so that you really belong into your plan something that will let everyone continue to think about what this country is about

Speaker 6 00:27:56.060
Anyone who's interested in finding out about the community programs and educational programs of the corporation should call for 9 0 8 5 6 0 and those who are interested in educational programs at the Board of Education should call a florist Jackson at 5 9 6 3 8 8 6 Our guest on tonight soul of reason have been Robert Williams and Allen Dempsey from New York City bicentennial corporation and Florence Jackson of the Bureau of social studies at New York City Board of Education discussing educational and community programs for the new york city bicentennial
